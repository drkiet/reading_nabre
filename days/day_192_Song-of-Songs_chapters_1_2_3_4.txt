Day 192:

Reading Song-of-Songs, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: 1 The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s.
The Woman Speaks of Her Lover

    2: 
W Let him kiss me with kisses of his mouth,
    for your love is better than wine,[c]

    3: 
    better than the fragrance of your perfumes.
Your name is a flowing perfume—
therefore young women love you.

    4: 
Draw me after you! Let us run!
    The king has brought me to his bed chambers.
Let us exult and rejoice in you;
    let us celebrate your love: it is beyond wine!
    Rightly do they love you!
Love’s Boast

    5: 
W I am black and beautiful,
    Daughters of Jerusalem—
Like the tents of Qedar,
    like the curtains of Solomon.

    6: 
Do not stare at me because I am so black,
    because the sun has burned me.
The sons of my mother were angry with me;
    they charged me with the care of the vineyards:
    my own vineyard I did not take care of.
Love’s Inquiry

    7: 
W Tell me, you whom my soul loves,
    where you shepherd, where you give rest at midday.
Why should I be like one wandering
    after the flocks of your companions?

    8: 
M If you do not know,
    most beautiful among women,
Follow the tracks of the flock
    and pasture your lambs
    near the shepherds’ tents.
Love’s Vision

    9: M To a mare among Pharaoh’s chariotry
    I compare you, my friend:

    10: 
Your cheeks lovely in pendants,
    your neck in jewels.

    11: 
We will make pendants of gold for you,
    and ornaments of silver.
How Near Is Love!

    12: 
W While the king was upon his couch,
    my spikenard gave forth its fragrance.

    13: 
My lover is to me a sachet of myrrh;
    between my breasts he lies.

    14: 
My lover is to me a cluster of henna
    from the vineyards of En-gedi.

    15: 
M How beautiful you are, my friend,
    how beautiful! your eyes are doves!

    16: 
W How beautiful you are, my lover—
    handsome indeed!
Verdant indeed is our couch;

    17: 
    the beams of our house are cedars,
    our rafters, cypresses.


  Chapter 2.

    1: 
    2: 1 
W I am a flower of Sharon,
    a lily of the valleys.
2 
M Like a lily among thorns,
    so is my friend among women.

    3: 
W Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods,
    so is my lover among men.
In his shadow I delight to sit,
    and his fruit is sweet to my taste.

    4: 
He brought me to the banquet hall
    and his glance at me signaled love.

    5: 
Strengthen me with raisin cakes,
    refresh me with apples,
    for I am sick with love.

    6: 
His left hand is under my head
    and his right arm embraces me.

    7: 
I adjure you, Daughters of Jerusalem,
    by the gazelles and the does of the field,
Do not awaken, or stir up love
    until it is ready.
Her Lover’s Visit Remembered

    8: 
W The sound of my lover! here he comes
    springing across the mountains,
    leaping across the hills.

    9: My lover is like a gazelle
    or a young stag.
See! He is standing behind our wall,
    gazing through the windows,
    peering through the lattices.

    10: 
My lover speaks and says to me,
    M “Arise, my friend, my beautiful one,
    and come!

    11: 
For see, the winter is past,
    the rains are over and gone.

    12: 
The flowers appear on the earth,
    the time of pruning the vines has come,
    and the song of the turtledove is heard in our land.

    13: 
The fig tree puts forth its figs,
    and the vines, in bloom, give forth fragrance.
Arise, my friend, my beautiful one,
    and come!

    14: 
My dove in the clefts of the rock,
    in the secret recesses of the cliff,
Let me see your face,
    let me hear your voice,
For your voice is sweet,
    and your face is lovely.”

    15: 
W Catch us the foxes, the little foxes
    that damage the vineyards; for our vineyards are in bloom!

    16: 
My lover belongs to me and I to him;
    he feeds among the lilies.

    17: 
Until the day grows cool and the shadows flee,
    roam, my lover,
Like a gazelle or a young stag
    upon the rugged mountains.


  Chapter 3.

    1: 
W On my bed at night I sought him
    whom my soul loves—
I sought him but I did not find him.

    2: 
    3: Loss and Discovery
1 
W On my bed at night I sought him
    whom my soul loves—
I sought him but I did not find him.
2 
“Let me rise then and go about the city,[b]
    through the streets and squares;
Let me seek him whom my soul loves.”
    I sought him but I did not find him.
3 
The watchmen found me,
    as they made their rounds in the city:
    “Him whom my soul loves—have you seen him?”

    4: 
Hardly had I left them
    when I found him whom my soul loves.
I held him and would not let him go
    until I had brought him to my mother’s house,
    to the chamber of her who conceived me.

    5: 
I adjure you, Daughters of Jerusalem,
    by the gazelles and the does of the field,
Do not awaken or stir up love
    until it is ready.
Solomon’s Wedding Procession

    6: 
D Who is this coming up from the desert,
    like columns of smoke
Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
    with all kinds of exotic powders?

    7: 
See! it is the litter of Solomon;
    sixty valiant men surround it,
    of the valiant men of Israel:

    8: 
All of them expert with the sword,
    skilled in battle,
Each with his sword at his side
    against the terrors of the night.

    9: King Solomon made himself an enclosed litter
    of wood from Lebanon.

    10: 
He made its columns of silver,
    its roof of gold,
Its seat of purple cloth,
    its interior lovingly fitted.
Daughters of Jerusalem, 
    11: go out
    and look upon King Solomon
In the crown with which his mother has crowned him
    on the day of his marriage,
    on the day of the joy of his heart.


  Chapter 4.

    1: 
M, How beautiful you are, my friend,
    how beautiful you are!
Your eyes are doves
    behind your veil.
Your hair is like a flock of goats
    streaming down Mount Gilead.

    2: 
Your teeth are like a flock of ewes to be shorn,
    that come up from the washing,
All of them big with twins,
    none of them barren.

    3: 
    4: The Beauty of the Woman
1 
M, How beautiful you are, my friend,
    how beautiful you are!
Your eyes are doves
    behind your veil.
Your hair is like a flock of goats
    streaming down Mount Gilead.
2 
Your teeth[b] are like a flock of ewes to be shorn,
    that come up from the washing,
All of them big with twins,
    none of them barren.
3 
Like a scarlet strand, your lips,
    and your mouth—lovely!
Like pomegranate[c] halves, your cheeks
    behind your veil.
4 
Like a tower of David, your neck,
    built in courses,
A thousand shields hanging upon it,
    all the armor of warriors.[d]

    5: 
Your breasts are like two fawns,
    twins of a gazelle
    feeding among the lilies.

    6: 
Until the day grows cool
    and the shadows flee,
    I shall go to the mountain of myrrh,
    to the hill of frankincense.

    7: 
You are beautiful in every way, my friend,
    there is no flaw in you!

    8: 
With me from Lebanon, my bride!
    With me from Lebanon, come!
Descend from the peak of Amana,
    from the peak of Senir and Hermon,
From the lairs of lions,
    from the leopards’ heights.

    9: You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride;
    you have ravished my heart with one glance of your eyes,
    with one bead of your necklace.

    10: 
How beautiful is your love,
    my sister, my bride,
How much better is your love than wine,
    and the fragrance of your perfumes than any spice!

    11: 
Your lips drip honey, my bride,
    honey and milk are under your tongue;
And the fragrance of your garments
    is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
The Lover’s Garden

    12: 
M A garden enclosed, my sister, my bride,
    a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed!

    13: 
Your branches are a grove of pomegranates,
    with fruits of choicest yield:
Henna with spikenard,

    14: 
spikenard and saffron,
Sweet cane and cinnamon,
    with all kinds of frankincense;
Myrrh and aloes,
    with all the finest spices;

    15: 
A garden fountain, a well of living water,
    streams flowing from Lebanon.

    16: 
Awake, north wind!
    Come, south wind!
Blow upon my garden
    that its perfumes may spread abroad.
W Let my lover come to his garden
    and eat its fruits of choicest yield.
