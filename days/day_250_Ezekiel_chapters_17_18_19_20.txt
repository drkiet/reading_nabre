Day 250:

Reading Ezekiel, chapters ['17', '18', '19', '20']:

  Chapter 17.

    1: 
The Eagles and the Vine. 1 The word of the Lord came to me: 
    2: Son of man, propose a riddle, and tell this proverb to the house of Israel: 
    3: Thus says the Lord God:
The great eagle, with wide wingspan
    and long feathers, with thick plumage,
    many-hued, came to Lebanon.
He plucked the crest of the cedar,

    4: 
    broke off its topmost branch,
And brought it to a land of merchants,
    set it in a city of traders.

    5: 
Then he took some native seed
    and planted it in fertile soil;
A shoot beside plentiful waters,
    like a willow he planted it,

    6: 
    7: The Eagles and the Vine. 1 The word of the Lord came to me: 2 Son of man, propose a riddle, and tell this proverb to the house of Israel: 3 Thus says the Lord God:
The great eagle, with wide wingspan
    and long feathers, with thick plumage,
    many-hued, came to Lebanon.
He plucked the crest of the cedar,
4 
    broke off its topmost branch,
And brought it to a land of merchants,
    set it in a city of traders.
5 
Then he took some native seed
    and planted it in fertile soil;
A shoot beside plentiful waters,
    like a willow he planted it,
6 
That it might sprout and become a vine,
    dense and low-lying,
With its branches turned toward him,
    its roots beneath it.
Thus it became a vine, produced branches,
    and put forth shoots.
7 
Then another great eagle appeared,
    with wide wingspan, rich in plumage,
And see! This vine bent its roots to him,
    sent out branches for him to water.
From the bed where it was planted,

    8: 
    it was transplanted to a fertile field
By abundant waters, to produce branches,
    to bear fruit, to become a majestic vine.

    9: Say: Thus says the Lord God: Can it thrive?
Will he not tear up its roots
    and strip its fruit?
Then all its green leaves will wither—
    neither strong arm nor mighty nation
    is needed to uproot it.

    10: 
True, it is planted; but will it thrive?
    Will it not wither up
When the east wind strikes it,
    wither in the very bed where it sprouted?

    11: The word of the Lord came to me:

    12: 
Now say to the rebellious house:
    Do you not understand this? Tell them!
The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem
    and took away its king and officials
    and brought them to him in Babylon.

    13: 
After removing the nobles from the land,
    he then took one of the royal line
And made a covenant with him,
    binding him under oath,

    14: 
To be a humble kingdom,
    without high aspirations,
    to keep his covenant and so survive.

    15: 
But this one rebelled against him
    by sending envoys to Egypt
To obtain horses and a mighty army.
    Can he thrive?
Can he escape if he does this?
    Can he break a covenant and go free?

    16: 
    17: The Eagles and the Vine. 1 The word of the Lord came to me: 2 Son of man, propose a riddle, and tell this proverb to the house of Israel: 3 Thus says the Lord God:
The great eagle, with wide wingspan
    and long feathers, with thick plumage,
    many-hued, came to Lebanon.
He plucked the crest of the cedar,
4 
    broke off its topmost branch,
And brought it to a land of merchants,
    set it in a city of traders.
5 
Then he took some native seed
    and planted it in fertile soil;
A shoot beside plentiful waters,
    like a willow he planted it,
6 
That it might sprout and become a vine,
    dense and low-lying,
With its branches turned toward him,
    its roots beneath it.
Thus it became a vine, produced branches,
    and put forth shoots.
7 
Then another great eagle appeared,
    with wide wingspan, rich in plumage,
And see! This vine bent its roots to him,
    sent out branches for him to water.
From the bed where it was planted,
8 
    it was transplanted to a fertile field
By abundant waters, to produce branches,
    to bear fruit, to become a majestic vine.
9 
Say: Thus says the Lord God: Can it thrive?
Will he not tear up its roots
    and strip its fruit?
Then all its green leaves will wither—
    neither strong arm nor mighty nation
    is needed to uproot it.
10 
True, it is planted; but will it thrive?
    Will it not wither up
When the east wind strikes it,
    wither in the very bed where it sprouted?
11 The word of the Lord came to me:
12 
Now say to the rebellious house:
    Do you not understand this? Tell them!
The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem
    and took away its king and officials
    and brought them to him in Babylon.
13 
After removing the nobles from the land,
    he then took one of the royal line
And made a covenant with him,
    binding him under oath,
14 
To be a humble kingdom,
    without high aspirations,
    to keep his covenant and so survive.
15 
But this one rebelled against him
    by sending envoys to Egypt
To obtain horses and a mighty army.
    Can he thrive?
Can he escape if he does this?
    Can he break a covenant and go free?
16 
As I live—oracle of the Lord God—
    in the house of the king who set him up to rule,
Whose oath he ignored and whose covenant he broke,
    there in Babylon I swear he shall die!
17 
Pharaoh shall not help him on the day of battle,
    with a great force and mighty horde,
When ramps are thrown up and siege works built
    for the cutting down of many lives.

    18: 
He ignored his oath, breaking his covenant;
    even though he gave his hand, he did all these things—
    he shall not escape!

    19: 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God:
    As I live, my oath which he spurned,
And my covenant which he broke,
    I will bring down on his head.

    20: 
I will spread my net over him,
    and he will be caught in my snare.
I will bring him to Babylon
    to judge him there
    because he broke faith with me.

    21: 
Any among his forces who escape
    will fall by the sword,
And whoever might survive
    will be scattered to the winds.
Thus you will know that I the Lord have spoken.

    22: 
Thus says the Lord God:
I, too, will pluck from the crest of the cedar
    the highest branch.
From the top a tender shoot
    I will break off and transplant
    on a high, lofty mountain.

    23: 
On the mountain height of Israel
    I will plant it.
It shall put forth branches and bear fruit,
    and become a majestic cedar.
Every small bird will nest under it,
    all kinds of winged birds will dwell
    in the shade of its branches.

    24: 
Every tree of the field will know
    that I am the Lord.
I bring low the high tree,
    lift high the lowly tree,
Wither up the green tree,
    and make the dry tree bloom.
As I, the Lord, have spoken, so will I do!


  Chapter 18.

    1: 
Personal Responsibility. 1 The word of the Lord came to me: Son of man, 
    2: what is the meaning of this proverb you recite in the land of Israel:
“Parents eat sour grapes,
    but the children’s teeth are set on edge”?

    3: As I live—oracle of the Lord God: I swear that none of you will ever repeat this proverb in Israel. 
    4: For all life is mine: the life of the parent is like the life of the child, both are mine. Only the one who sins shall die!

    5: If a man is just—if he does what is right, 
    6: if he does not eat on the mountains, or raise his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel; if he does not defile a neighbor’s wife, or have relations with a woman during her period; 
    7: 
    8: Personal Responsibility. 1 The word of the Lord came to me: Son of man, 2 what is the meaning of this proverb you recite in the land of Israel:
“Parents eat sour grapes,
    but the children’s teeth are set on edge”?
3 As I live—oracle of the Lord God: I swear that none of you will ever repeat this proverb in Israel. 4 For all life is mine: the life of the parent is like the life of the child, both are mine. Only the one who sins shall die!
5 If a man is just—if he does what is right, 6 if he does not eat on the mountains,[b] or raise his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel; if he does not defile a neighbor’s wife, or have relations with a woman during her period; 7 if he oppresses no one, gives back the pledge received for a debt, commits no robbery; gives food to the hungry and clothes the naked; 8 if he does not lend at interest or exact usury; if he refrains from evildoing and makes a fair judgment between two opponents; 
    9: f he walks by my statutes and is careful to observe my ordinances, that man is just—he shall surely live—oracle of the Lord God.

    10: But if he begets a son who is violent and commits murder, or does any of these things, 
    11: even though the father does none of them—a son who eats on the mountains, defiles the wife of his neighbor, 
    12: oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not give back a pledge, raises his eyes to idols, does abominable things, 
    13: lends at interest and exacts usury—this son certainly shall not live. Because he practiced all these abominations, he shall surely be put to death; his own blood shall be on him.

    14: But, in turn, if he begets a son who sees all the sins his father commits, yet fears and does not imitate him— 
    15: a son who does not eat on the mountains, or raise his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile a neighbor’s wife; 
    16: who does not oppress anyone, or exact a pledge, or commit robbery; who gives his food to the hungry and clothes the naked; 
    17: 
    18: Personal Responsibility. 1 The word of the Lord came to me: Son of man, 2 what is the meaning of this proverb you recite in the land of Israel:
“Parents eat sour grapes,
    but the children’s teeth are set on edge”?
3 As I live—oracle of the Lord God: I swear that none of you will ever repeat this proverb in Israel. 4 For all life is mine: the life of the parent is like the life of the child, both are mine. Only the one who sins shall die!
5 If a man is just—if he does what is right, 6 if he does not eat on the mountains,[b] or raise his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel; if he does not defile a neighbor’s wife, or have relations with a woman during her period; 7 if he oppresses no one, gives back the pledge received for a debt, commits no robbery; gives food to the hungry and clothes the naked; 8 if he does not lend at interest or exact usury; if he refrains from evildoing and makes a fair judgment between two opponents; 9 if he walks by my statutes and is careful to observe my ordinances, that man is just—he shall surely live—oracle of the Lord God.
10 But if he begets a son who is violent and commits murder, or does any of these things, 11 even though the father does none of them—a son who eats on the mountains, defiles the wife of his neighbor, 12 oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not give back a pledge, raises his eyes to idols, does abominable things, 13 lends at interest and exacts usury—this son certainly shall not live. Because he practiced all these abominations, he shall surely be put to death; his own blood shall be on him.
14 But, in turn, if he begets a son who sees all the sins his father commits, yet fears and does not imitate him— 15 a son who does not eat on the mountains, or raise his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile a neighbor’s wife; 16 who does not oppress anyone, or exact a pledge, or commit robbery; who gives his food to the hungry and clothes the naked; 17 who refrains from evildoing, accepts no interest or usury, but keeps my ordinances and walks in my statutes—this one shall not die for the sins of his father. He shall surely live! 18 Only the father, since he committed extortion and robbed his brother, and did what was not good among his people—he will die because of his sin! 
    19: You ask: “Why is not the son charged with the guilt of his father?” Because the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to observe all my statutes—he shall surely live! 
    20: Only the one who sins shall die. The son shall not be charged with the guilt of his father, nor shall the father be charged with the guilt of his son. Justice belongs to the just, and wickedness to the wicked.

    21: But if the wicked man turns away from all the sins he has committed, if he keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, he shall surely live. He shall not die! 
    22: None of the crimes he has committed shall be remembered against him; he shall live because of the justice he has shown. 
    23: Do I find pleasure in the death of the wicked—oracle of the Lord God? Do I not rejoice when they turn from their evil way and live?

    24: And if the just turn from justice and do evil, like all the abominations the wicked do, can they do this evil and still live? None of the justice they did shall be remembered, because they acted treacherously and committed these sins; because of this, they shall die. 
    25: You say, “The Lord’s way is not fair!” Hear now, house of Israel: Is it my way that is unfair? Are not your ways unfair? 
    26: When the just turn away from justice to do evil and die, on account of the evil they did they must die. 
    27: But if the wicked turn from the wickedness they did and do what is right and just, they save their lives; 
    28: since they turned away from all the sins they committed, they shall live; they shall not die. 
    29: But the house of Israel says, “The Lord’s way is not fair!” Is it my way that is not fair, house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are not fair?

    30: Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, all of you according to your ways—oracle of the Lord God. Turn, turn back from all your crimes, that they may not be a cause of sin for you ever again. 
    31: Cast away from you all the crimes you have committed, and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. Why should you die, house of Israel? 
    32: For I find no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies—oracle of the Lord God. Turn back and live!


  Chapter 19.

    1: 
Allegory of the Lions
1 As for you, raise a lamentation over the princes of Israel, 
    2: and say:
What a lioness was your mother,
    a lion among lions!
She made her lair among young lions,
    to raise her cubs;

    3: 
One cub she raised up,
    a young lion he became;
He learned to tear apart prey,
    he devoured people.

    4: 
Nations heard about him;
    in their pit he was caught;
They took him away with hooks
    to the land of Egypt.

    5: 
When she realized she had waited in vain,
    she lost hope.
She took another of her cubs,
    and made him a young lion.

    6: 
He prowled among the lions,
    became a young lion;
He learned to tear apart prey,
    he devoured people.

    7: 
He ravaged their strongholds,
    laid waste their cities.
The earth and everything in it were terrified
    at the sound of his roar.

    8: 
    9: llegory of the Lions

6 
He prowled among the lions,

7 
He ravaged their strongholds,
    laid waste their cities.
The earth and everything in it were terrified
    at the sound of his roar.
8 
Nations laid out against him
    snares all around;
They spread their net for him,
    in their pit he was caught.
9 
They put him in fetters and took him away
    to the king of Babylon,
So his roar would no longer be heard
    on the mountains of Israel.
Allegory of the Vine Branch

    10: 
Your mother was like a leafy vine
    planted by water,
Fruitful and full of branches
    because of abundant water.

    11: 
One strong branch grew
    into a royal scepter.
So tall it towered among the clouds,
    conspicuous in height,
    with dense foliage.

    12: 
But she was torn out in fury
    and flung to the ground;
The east wind withered her up,
    her fruit was plucked away;
Her strongest branch dried up,
    fire devoured it.

    13: 
Now she is planted in a wilderness,
    in a dry, parched land.

    14: 
Fire flashed from her branch,
    and devoured her shoots;
Now she does not have a strong branch,
    a royal scepter!
This is a lamentation and serves as a lamentation.


  Chapter 20.

    1: 
    2: 
Israel’s History of Infidelity. 1 In the seventh year, on the tenth day of the fifth month, some of the elders of Israel came to consult the Lord and sat down before me. 2 Then the word of the Lord came to me: 
    3: Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Have you come to consult me? As I live, I will not allow myself to be consulted by you!—oracle of the Lord God.

    4: Will you judge them? Will you judge, son of man? Tell them about the abominations of their ancestors, 
    5: and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: The day I chose Israel, I swore to the descendants of the house of Jacob; I revealed myself to them in the land of Egypt and swore to them, saying: I am the Lord, your God. 
    6: That day I swore to bring them out of the land of Egypt to the land I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, a jewel among all lands. 
    7: Then I said to them: Throw away, each of you, the detestable things that held your eyes; do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the Lord, your God.

    8: But they rebelled and refused to listen to me; none of them threw away the detestable things that held their eyes, nor did they abandon the idols of Egypt. Then I considered pouring out my fury and spending my anger against them there in the land of Egypt. 
    9:  acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be desecrated in the eyes of the nations among whom they were: in the eyes of the nations I had made myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. 
    10: Therefore I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. 
    11: Then I gave them my statutes and made known to them my ordinances, so that everyone who keeps them has life through them. 
    12: I also gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them, to show that it is I, the Lord, who makes them holy.

    13: But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not observe my statutes, and they rejected my ordinances that bring life to those who keep them. My sabbaths, too, they desecrated grievously. Then I considered pouring out my fury on them in the wilderness to put an end to them, 
    14: but I acted for the sake of my name, so it would not be desecrated in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. 
    15: Nevertheless in the wilderness I swore to them that I would not bring them into the land I had given them—a land flowing with milk and honey, a jewel among all the lands. 
    16: Their hearts followed after their idols so closely that they did not live by my statutes, but rejected my ordinances and desecrated my sabbaths. 
    17: But I looked on them with pity, not wanting to destroy them, so I did not put an end to them in the wilderness.

    18: Then I said to their children in the wilderness: Do not follow the statutes of your parents. Do not keep their ordinances. Do not defile yourselves with their idols. 
    19: 
    20: Israel’s History of Infidelity. 1 In the seventh year, on the tenth day of the fifth month, some of the elders of Israel came to consult the Lord and sat down before me. 2 Then the word of the Lord came to me: 3 Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Have you come to consult me? As I live, I will not allow myself to be consulted by you!—oracle of the Lord God.
4 Will you judge them? Will you judge, son of man? Tell them about the abominations of their ancestors, 5 and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: The day I chose Israel, I swore to the descendants of the house of Jacob; I revealed myself to them in the land of Egypt and swore to them, saying: I am the Lord, your God. 6 That day I swore to bring them out of the land of Egypt to the land I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, a jewel among all lands. 7 Then I said to them: Throw away, each of you, the detestable things[b] that held your eyes; do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the Lord, your God.
8 But they rebelled and refused to listen to me; none of them threw away the detestable things that held their eyes, nor did they abandon the idols of Egypt. Then I considered pouring out my fury and spending my anger against them there in the land of Egypt. 9 I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be desecrated in the eyes of the nations among whom they were: in the eyes of the nations I had made myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. 10 Therefore I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. 11 Then I gave them my statutes and made known to them my ordinances, so that everyone who keeps them has life through them. 12 I also gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them, to show that it is I, the Lord, who makes them holy.
13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not observe my statutes, and they rejected my ordinances that bring life to those who keep them. My sabbaths, too, they desecrated grievously. Then I considered pouring out my fury on them in the wilderness to put an end to them, 14 but I acted for the sake of my name, so it would not be desecrated in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. 15 Nevertheless in the wilderness I swore to them that I would not bring them into the land I had given them—a land flowing with milk and honey, a jewel among all the lands. 16 Their hearts followed after their idols so closely that they did not live by my statutes, but rejected my ordinances and desecrated my sabbaths. 17 But I looked on them with pity, not wanting to destroy them, so I did not put an end to them in the wilderness.
18 Then I said to their children in the wilderness: Do not follow the statutes of your parents. Do not keep their ordinances. Do not defile yourselves with their idols. 19 I am the Lord, your God: follow my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances; 20 keep holy my sabbaths as a sign between me and you so that you may know that I am the Lord, your God. 
    21: But their children rebelled against me: they did not follow my statutes or keep my ordinances that bring life to those who observe them; my sabbaths they desecrated. Then I considered pouring out my fury on them, spending my anger against them in the wilderness; 
    22: but I stayed my hand, acting for the sake of my name, lest it be desecrated in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out. 
    23: Nevertheless I swore to them in the wilderness that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them in other lands, 
    24: because they did not carry out my ordinances, but rejected my statutes and desecrated my sabbaths, having eyes only for the idols of their ancestors. 
    25: Therefore I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances through which they could not have life. 
    26: I let them become defiled by their offerings, by having them make a fiery offering of every womb’s firstborn, in order to ruin them so they might know that I am the Lord.

    27: Therefore speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and tell them: Thus says the Lord God: In this way also your ancestors blasphemed me, breaking faith with me. 
    28: When I brought them to the land I had sworn to give them, and they saw all its high hills and leafy trees, there they offered sacrifices, there they made offerings to provoke me, there they sent up sweet-smelling oblations, there they poured out their libations. 
    29: So I said to them, “What is this high place to which you go?” Thus its name became “high place” even to this day. 
    30: Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: Will you defile yourselves in the way your ancestors did? Will you lust after their detestable idols? 
    31: By offering your gifts, by making your children pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols even to this day. Shall I let myself be consulted by you, house of Israel? As I live—oracle of the Lord God—I swear I will not let myself be consulted by you!

    32: What has entered your mind shall never happen: You are thinking, “We shall be like the nations, like the peoples of foreign lands, serving wood and stone.” 
    33: As I live—oracle of the Lord God—with mighty hand and outstretched arm, with wrath poured out, I swear I will be king over you! 
    34: With mighty hand and outstretched arm, with wrath poured out, I will bring you out from the nations and gather you from the countries over which you are scattered; 
    35: I will lead you to the wilderness of the peoples and enter into judgment with you face to face. 
    36: Just as I entered into judgment with your ancestors in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you—oracle of the Lord God. 
    37: Thus I will make you pass under the staff and will impose on you the terms of the covenant. 
    38: I will sort out from you those who defied me and rebelled against me; from the land where they resided as aliens I will bring them out, but they shall not return to the land of Israel. Thus you shall know that I am the Lord.

    39: As for you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord God: Go! each of you, and worship your idols. Listen to me! You shall never again desecrate my holy name with your offerings and your idols! 
    40: For on my holy mountain, on the highest mountain in Israel—oracle of the Lord God—there the whole house of Israel shall worship me; there in the land I will accept them all, there I will claim your tributes, the best of your offerings, from all your holy things. 
    41: As a sweet-smelling oblation I will accept you, when I bring you from among the nations and gather you out of the lands over which you were scattered; and through you I will manifest my holiness in the sight of the nations. 
    42: Thus you shall know that I am the Lord, when I bring you back to the soil of Israel, the land I swore to give your ancestors. 
    43: There you shall remember your ways, all the deeds by which you defiled yourselves; and you shall loathe yourselves because of all the evil you did. 
    44: And you shall know that I am the Lord when I deal with you thus, for the sake of my name, not according to your evil ways and wanton deeds, house of Israel—oracle of the Lord God.
