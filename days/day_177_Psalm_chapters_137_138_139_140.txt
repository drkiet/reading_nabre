    1: 7
Sorrow and Hope in Exile
I
1 
By the rivers of Babylon
    there we sat weeping
    when we remembered Zion.

    3: 
Sorrow and Hope in Exile
I
1 
By the rivers of Babylon
    there we sat weeping
    when we remembered Zion.
2 
On the poplars in its midst
    we hung up our harps.
3 
For there our captors asked us
    for the words of a song;
Our tormentors, for joy:
    “Sing for us a song of Zion!”

    4: 
But how could we sing a song of the Lord
    in a foreign land?
II

    5: 
If I forget you, Jerusalem,
    may my right hand forget.

6 
May my tongue stick to my palate
    if I do not remember you,
If I do not exalt Jerusalem
    beyond all my delights.
III
7 
Remember, Lord, against Edom
    that day at Jerusalem.
They said: “Level it, level it
    down to its foundations!”

    8: 
Desolate Daughter Babylon, you shall be destroyed,
    blessed the one who pays you back
    what you have done us!

    9: Blessed the one who seizes your children
    and smashes them against the rock.

I
Lord, you have probed me, you know me:
2 
    you know when I sit and stand;[b]
    you understand my thoughts from afar.
3 
You sift through my travels and my rest;
    with all my ways you are familiar.

    4: 
Even before a word is on my tongue,
    Lord, you know it all.

    5: 
Behind and before you encircle me
    and rest your hand upon me.

    6: 
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
    far too lofty for me to reach.

    7: 
Where can I go from your spirit?
    From your presence, where can I flee?

8 
If I ascend to the heavens, you are there;
    if I lie down in Sheol, there you are.
9 
If I take the wings of dawn[c]
    and dwell beyond the sea,

    10: 
Even there your hand guides me,
    your right hand holds me fast.

    11: 
If I say, “Surely darkness shall hide me,
    and night shall be my light”—

II
13 
You formed my inmost being;
    you knit me in my mother’s womb.

    14: 
I praise you, because I am wonderfully made;
    wonderful are your works!
    My very self you know.

    15: 
My bones are not hidden from you,
When I was being made in secret,
    fashioned in the depths of the earth.

    16: 
Your eyes saw me unformed;
    in your book all are written down;
    my days were shaped, before one came to be.
III

    17: 
How precious to me are your designs, O God;
    how vast the sum of them!

    18: 
Were I to count them, they would outnumber the sands;
    when I complete them, still you are with me.

    19: 
When you would destroy the wicked, O God,
    the bloodthirsty depart from me!

    20: 
Your foes who conspire a plot against you
    are exalted in vain.
IV

    21: 
Do I not hate, Lord, those who hate you?
    Those who rise against you, do I not loathe?

    22: 
With fierce hatred I hate them,
    enemies I count as my own.

    23: 
Probe me, God, know my heart;
    try me, know my thoughts.

    24: 
See if there is a wicked path in me;
    lead me along an ancient path.

Then the righteous will give thanks to your name;
    the upright will dwell in your presence.
