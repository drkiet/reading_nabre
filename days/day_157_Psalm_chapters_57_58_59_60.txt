    hungry for human prey.
Their teeth are spears and arrows;
    their tongue, a sharpened sword.

They have set a trap for my feet;
    my soul is bowed down;
They have dug a pit before me.
    May they fall into it themselves!
Selah

    8: 
My heart is steadfast, God,
    my heart is steadfast.
    I will sing and chant praise.

    9: Awake, my soul;
    awake, lyre and harp!
    I will wake the dawn.

    10: 
I will praise you among the peoples, Lord;
    I will chant your praise among the nations.

For your mercy towers to the heavens;
    your faithfulness reaches to the skies.

Exalt yourself over the heavens, God;
    may your glory appear above all the earth.


  Chapter 58.

    1: For the leader. Do not destroy. A miktam of David.
I

    2: 
Do you indeed pronounce justice, O gods;
    do you judge fairly you children of Adam?

    3: 
No, you freely engage in crime;
    your hands dispense violence to the earth.
II

    4:

3 
No, you freely engage in crime;
    your hands dispense violence to the earth.
II
4 
The wicked have been corrupt since birth;
    liars from the womb, they have gone astray.
5 
[d]Their venom is like the venom of a snake,
    like that of a serpent stopping its ears,

    6: 
So as not to hear the voice of the charmer
    or the enchanter with cunning spells.

III
7 
O God, smash the teeth in their mouths;
    break the fangs of these lions, Lord!
8 
Make them vanish like water flowing away;
    trodden down, let them wither like grass.

    9: Let them dissolve like a snail that oozes away,
    like an untimely birth that never sees the sun.

    10: 
Suddenly, like brambles or thistles,
    have the whirlwind snatch them away.

    11: 
Then the just shall rejoice to see the vengeance
    and bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.

    12: 
Then people will say:
    “Truly there is a reward for the just;
    there is a God who is judge on earth!”

3 
Deliver me from evildoers;
    from the bloodthirsty save me.
4 
They have set an ambush for my life;
    the powerful conspire against me.
For no offense or misdeed of mine, Lord,
5 
    for no fault they hurry to take up arms.
Come near and see my plight!

    6: 
    You, Lord God of hosts, are the God of Israel!
Awake! Punish all the nations.
    Have no mercy on these worthless traitors.
Selah

    7: 
Each evening they return,
    growling like dogs, prowling the city.

Selah
7 
Each evening they return,
    growling like dogs, prowling the city.
8 
Their mouths pour out insult;
    sharp words are on their lips.
    They say: “Who is there to hear?”[c]
9 
But you, Lord, laugh at them;
    you deride all the nations.

    10: 
My strength, for you I watch;
    you, God, are my fortress,

    11: 
    my loving God.
II
May God go before me,
    and show me my fallen foes.

    12: 
Slay them, God,
    lest they deceive my people.
Shake them by your power;
    Lord, our shield, bring them down.

    13: 
For the sinful words of their mouths and lips
    let them be caught in their pride.
For the lies they have told under oath

    14: 
    destroy them in anger,
    destroy till they are no more.
Then people will know God rules over Jacob,
    yes, even to the ends of the earth.
Selah

    15: 
Each evening they return,
    growling like dogs, prowling the city.

    16: 
They roam about as scavengers;
    if they are not filled, they howl.
III

    17: 
But I shall sing of your strength,
    extol your mercy at dawn,
For you are my fortress,
    my refuge in time of trouble.

    18: 
My strength, your praise I will sing;
    you, God, are my fortress, my loving God.


  Chapter 60.

    1: For the leader; according to “The Lily of.…” A miktam of David (for teaching), 
    2: when he fought against Aram-Naharaim and Aram-Zobah; and Joab, coming back, killed twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
I

    3: 
O God, you rejected us, broke our defenses;
    you were angry but now revive us.

    4: 
You rocked the earth, split it open;
    repair the cracks for it totters.

    5: 
    6: 
Lament After Defeat in Battle
1 For the leader; according to “The Lily of.…” A miktam of David (for teaching), 2 when he fought against Aram-Naharaim and Aram-Zobah; and Joab, coming back, killed twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
I
3 
O God, you rejected us, broke our defenses;
    you were angry but now revive us.
4 
You rocked the earth, split it open;
    repair the cracks for it totters.
5 
You made your people go through hardship,
    made us stagger from the wine you gave us.
6 
Raise up a banner for those who revere you,
    a refuge for them out of bow shot.
Selah

    7: 
Help with your right hand and answer us
    that your loved ones may escape.
II

    8: 
In the sanctuary God promised:
    “I will exult, will apportion Shechem;
    the valley of Succoth I will measure out.

    9: Gilead is mine, mine is Manasseh;
    Ephraim is the helmet for my head,
    Judah, my own scepter.

    10: 
Moab is my washbowl;
    upon Edom I cast my sandal.
I will triumph over Philistia.”
III

    11: 
Who will bring me to the fortified city?
    Who will lead me into Edom?

    12: 
Was it not you who rejected us, God?
    Do you no longer march with our armies?

    13: 
Give us aid against the foe;
    worthless is human help.

    14: 
We will triumph with the help of God,
    who will trample down our foes.
