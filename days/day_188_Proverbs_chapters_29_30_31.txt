Day 188:

Reading Proverbs, chapters ['29', '30', '31']:

  Chapter 29.

    1: 
    2: 
1 
Those stiff-necked in the face of reproof
    in an instant will be shattered beyond cure.
2 
When the just flourish, the people rejoice;
    but when the wicked rule, the people groan.[b]

    3: 
Whoever loves wisdom gives joy to his father,
    but whoever consorts with harlots squanders his wealth.

    4: 
By justice a king builds up the land;
    but one who raises taxes tears it down.

    5: 
Those who speak flattery to their neighbor
    cast a net at their feet.

    6: 
The sin of the wicked is a trap,
    but the just run along joyfully.

    7: 
The just care for the cause of the poor;
    the wicked do not understand such care.

    8: 
    9:  
Those stiff-necked in the face of reproof
    in an instant will be shattered beyond cure.
2 
When the just flourish, the people rejoice;
    but when the wicked rule, the people groan.[b]
3 
Whoever loves wisdom gives joy to his father,
    but whoever consorts with harlots squanders his wealth.
4 
By justice a king builds up the land;
    but one who raises taxes tears it down.[c]
5 
Those who speak flattery to their neighbor
    cast a net at their feet.[d]
6 
The sin of the wicked is a trap,
    but the just run along joyfully.
7 
The just care for the cause of the poor;
    the wicked do not understand such care.[e]
8 
Scoffers enflame the city,
    but the wise calm the fury.
9 
If a wise person disputes with a fool,
    there is railing and ridicule but no resolution.

    10: 
The bloodthirsty hate the blameless,
    but the upright seek his life.

    11: 
Fools give vent to all their anger;
    but the wise, biding their time, control it.

    12: 
If rulers listen to lying words,
    their servants all become wicked.

    13: 
The poor and the oppressor meet:
    the Lord gives light to the eyes of both.

    14: 
If a king is honestly for the rights of the poor,
    his throne stands firm forever.

    15: 
The rod of correction gives wisdom,
    but uncontrolled youths disgrace their mothers.

    16: 
When the wicked increase, crime increases;
    but the just will behold their downfall.

    17: 
Discipline your children, and they will bring you comfort,
    and give delight to your soul.

    18: 
Without a vision the people lose restraint;
    but happy is the one who follows instruction.

    19: 
Not by words alone can servants be trained;
    for they understand but do not respond.

    20: 
Do you see someone hasty in speech?
    There is more hope for a fool!

    21: 
If servants are pampered from childhood
    they will turn out to be stubborn.

    22: 
The ill-tempered stir up strife,
    and the hotheaded cause many sins.

    23: 
Haughtiness brings humiliation,
    but the humble of spirit acquire honor.

    24: 
Partners of a thief hate themselves;
    they hear the imprecation but do not testify.

    25: 
Fear of others becomes a snare,
    but the one who trusts in the Lord is safe.

    26: 
Many curry favor with a ruler,
    but it is from the Lord that one receives justice.

    27: 
An abomination to the just, the evildoer;
    an abomination to the wicked, one whose way is straight.


  Chapter 30.

    1: The words of Agur, son of Jakeh the Massaite:
The pronouncement of mortal man: “I am weary, O God;
    I am weary, O God, and I am exhausted.

    2: 
    3: 
1 The words of Agur, son of Jakeh the Massaite:
The pronouncement of mortal man: “I am weary, O God;
    I am weary, O God, and I am exhausted.
2 
I am more brute than human being,
    without even human intelligence;
3 
[b]Neither have I learned wisdom,
    nor have I the knowledge of the Holy One.

    4: 
Who has gone up to heaven and come down again—
    who has cupped the wind in the hollow of the hand?
Who has bound up the waters in a cloak—
    who has established all the ends of the earth?
What is that person’s name, or the name of his son?”

    5: 
Every word of God is tested;
    he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.

    6: 
Add nothing to his words,
    lest he reprimand you, and you be proved a liar.

    7: 
Two things I ask of you,
    do not deny them to me before I die:

    8: 
Put falsehood and lying far from me,
    give me neither poverty nor riches;
    provide me only with the food I need;

    9: Lest, being full, I deny you,
    saying, “Who is the Lord?”
Or, being in want, I steal,
    and profane the name of my God.

    10: 
Do not criticize servants to their master,
    lest they curse you, and you have to pay the penalty.

    11: 
There are some who curse their fathers,
    and do not bless their mothers.

    12: 
There are some pure in their own eyes,
    yet not cleansed of their filth.

    13: 
There are some—how haughty their eyes!
    how overbearing their glance!

    14: 
There are some—their teeth are swords,
    their teeth are knives,
Devouring the needy from the earth,
    and the poor from the human race.

    15: 
The leech has two daughters:
    “Give,” and “Give.”
Three things never get their fill,
    four never say, “Enough!”

    16: 
Sheol, a barren womb,
    land that never gets its fill of water,
    and fire, which never says, “Enough!”

    17: 
The eye that mocks a father,
    or scorns the homage due a mother,
Will be plucked out by brook ravens;
    devoured by a brood of vultures.

    18: 
Three things are too wonderful for me,
    yes, four I cannot understand:

    19: 
The way of an eagle in the sky,
    the way of a serpent upon a rock,
The way of a ship on the high seas,
    and the way of a man with a woman.

    20: 
This is the way of an adulterous woman:
    she eats, wipes her mouth,
    and says, “I have done no wrong.”

    21: 
Under three things the earth trembles,
    yes, under four it cannot bear up:

    22: 
Under a slave who becomes king,
    and a fool who is glutted with food;

    23: 
Under an unloved woman who is wed,
    and a maidservant who displaces her mistress.

    24: 
Four things are among the smallest on the earth,
    and yet are exceedingly wise:

    25: 
Ants—a species not strong,
    yet they store up their food in the summer;

    26: 
Badgers—a species not mighty,
    yet they make their home in the crags;

    27: 
Locusts—they have no king,
    yet they march forth in formation;

    28: 
Lizards—you can catch them with your hands,
    yet they find their way into kings’ palaces.

    29: 
    30: 1 The words of Agur, son of Jakeh the Massaite:
The pronouncement of mortal man: “I am weary, O God;
    I am weary, O God, and I am exhausted.

    nor have I the knowledge of the Holy One.
4

    who has cupped the wind in the hollow of the hand?
Who has bound up the waters in a cloak—
    who has established all the ends of the earth?
What is that person’s name, or the name of his son?”[c]
5

    he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.

    and do not bless their mothers.

    how overbearing their glance!

Devouring the needy from the earth,
    and the poor from the human race.

    and the way of a man with a woman.
20 
This is the way of an adulterous woman:
    she eats, wipes her mouth,
    and says, “I have done no wrong.”[i]
21 
[j]Under three things the earth trembles,

22 
Under a slave who becomes king,
    and a fool who is glutted with food;
23 
Under an unloved woman who is wed,
    and a maidservant who displaces her mistress.
24

    and yet are exceedingly wise:
25

    yet they make their home in the crags;
27 
Locusts—they have no king,
    yet they march forth in formation;
28 
Lizards—you can catch them with your hands,
    yet they find their way into kings’ palaces.
29 
[l]Three things are stately in their stride,
    yes, four are stately in their carriage:
30 
The lion, mightiest of beasts,
    retreats before nothing;

    31: 
The strutting cock, and the he-goat,
    and the king at the head of his people.

    32: 
If you have foolishly been proud
    or presumptuous—put your hand on your mouth;

    33: 
For as the churning of milk produces curds,
    and the pressing of the nose produces blood,
    the churning of anger produces strife.


  Chapter 31.

    1: 1 The words of Lemuel, king of Massa, the instruction his mother taught him:

    2: 
    3: 
1 The words of Lemuel, king of Massa, the instruction his mother taught him:
2 
What are you doing, my son![c]
    what are you doing, son of my womb;
    what are you doing, son of my vows!
3 
Do not give your vigor to women,
    or your strength[d] to those who ruin kings.

    4: 
It is not for kings, Lemuel,
    not for kings to drink wine;
    strong drink is not for princes,

    5: 
Lest in drinking they forget what has been decreed,
    and violate the rights of any who are in need.

    6: 
Give strong drink to anyone who is perishing,
    and wine to the embittered;

    7: 
When they drink, they will forget their misery,
    and think no more of their troubles.

    8: 
Open your mouth in behalf of the mute,
    and for the rights of the destitute;

    9: Open your mouth, judge justly,
    defend the needy and the poor!
IX. Poem on the Woman of Worth

    10: 
Who can find a woman of worth?
    Far beyond jewels is her value.

    11: 
Her husband trusts her judgment;
    he does not lack income.

    12: 
She brings him profit, not loss,
    all the days of her life.

    13: 
She seeks out wool and flax
    and weaves with skillful hands.

    14: 
Like a merchant fleet,
    she secures her provisions from afar.

    15: 
She rises while it is still night,
    and distributes food to her household,
    a portion to her maidservants.

    16: 
She picks out a field and acquires it;
    from her earnings she plants a vineyard.

    17: 
She girds herself with strength;
    she exerts her arms with vigor.

    18: 
She enjoys the profit from her dealings;
    her lamp is never extinguished at night.

    19: 
She puts her hands to the distaff,
    and her fingers ply the spindle.

    20: 
She reaches out her hands to the poor,
    and extends her arms to the needy.

    21: 
She is not concerned for her household when it snows—
    all her charges are doubly clothed.

    22: 
She makes her own coverlets;
    fine linen and purple are her clothing.

    23: 
Her husband is prominent at the city gates
    as he sits with the elders of the land.

    24: 
She makes garments and sells them,
    and stocks the merchants with belts.

    25: 
She is clothed with strength and dignity,
    and laughs at the days to come.

    26: 
She opens her mouth in wisdom;
    kindly instruction is on her tongue.

    27: 
She watches over the affairs of her household,
    and does not eat the bread of idleness.

    28: 
Her children rise up and call her blessed;
    her husband, too, praises her:

    29: 
“Many are the women of proven worth,
    but you have excelled them all.”

    30: 
    31: 1 The words of Lemuel, king of Massa, the instruction his mother taught him:
2 
What are you doing, my son![c]
    what are you doing, son of my womb;
    what are you doing, son of my vows!
3 
Do not give your vigor to women,
    or your strength[d] to those who ruin kings.
4 
It is not for kings, Lemuel,
    not for kings to drink wine;
    strong drink is not for princes,
5 
Lest in drinking they forget what has been decreed,
    and violate the rights of any who are in need.
6 
Give strong drink to anyone who is perishing,
    and wine to the embittered;
7 
When they drink, they will forget their misery,
    and think no more of their troubles.
8 
Open your mouth in behalf of the mute,
    and for the rights of the destitute;
9 
Open your mouth, judge justly,
    defend the needy and the poor!

    a portion to her maidservants.

27

    and does not eat the bread of idleness.
28 
Her children rise up and call her blessed;
    her husband, too, praises her:
29 
“Many are the women of proven worth,
    but you have excelled them all.”
30 
Charm is deceptive and beauty fleeting;
    the woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.[o]
31 
Acclaim her for the work of her hands,
    and let her deeds praise her at the city gates.
