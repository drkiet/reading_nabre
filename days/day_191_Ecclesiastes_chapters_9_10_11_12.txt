Day 191:

Reading Ecclesiastes, chapters ['9', '10', '11', '12']:

  Chapter 9.

    1: All this I have kept in my heart and all this I examined: The just, the wise, and their deeds are in the hand of God. Love from hatred mortals cannot tell; both are before them. 
    2: Everything is the same for everybody: the same lot for the just and the wicked, for the good, for the clean and the unclean, for the one who offers sacrifice and the one who does not. As it is for the good, so it is for the sinner; as it is for the one who takes an oath, so it is for the one who fears an oath. 
    3: Among all the things that are done under the sun, this is the worst, that there is one lot for all. Hence the hearts of human beings are filled with evil, and madness is in their hearts during life; and afterward—to the dead!

    4: For whoever is chosen among all the living has hope: “A live dog is better off than a dead lion.” 
    5: For the living know that they are to die, but the dead no longer know anything. There is no further recompense for them, because all memory of them is lost. 
    6: For them, love and hatred and rivalry have long since perished. Never again will they have part in anything that is done under the sun.

    7: Go, eat your bread with joy and drink your wine with a merry heart, because it is now that God favors your works. 
    8: 
    9:  All this I have kept in my heart and all this I examined: The just, the wise, and their deeds are in the hand of God. Love from hatred mortals cannot tell; both are before them. 2 Everything is the same for everybody: the same lot for the just and the wicked, for the good, for the clean and the unclean, for the one who offers sacrifice and the one who does not. As it is for the good, so it is for the sinner; as it is for the one who takes an oath, so it is for the one who fears an oath. 3 Among all the things that are done under the sun, this is the worst, that there is one lot for all. Hence the hearts of human beings are filled with evil, and madness is in their hearts during life; and afterward—to the dead!
4 For whoever is chosen among all the living has hope: “A live dog[b] is better off than a dead lion.” 5 For the living know that they are to die, but the dead no longer know anything. There is no further recompense for them, because all memory of them is lost. 6 For them, love and hatred and rivalry have long since perished. Never again will they have part in anything that is done under the sun.
7 Go, eat your bread[c] with joy and drink your wine with a merry heart, because it is now that God favors your works. 8 At all times let your garments be white, and spare not the perfume for your head. 9 Enjoy life with the wife you love, all the days of the vain life granted you under the sun. This is your lot in life, for the toil of your labors under the sun. 
    10: Anything you can turn your hand to, do with what power you have; for there will be no work, no planning, no knowledge, no wisdom in Sheol where you are going.
The Time of Misfortune Is Not Known. 
    11: Again I saw under the sun that the race is not won by the swift, nor the battle by the valiant, nor a livelihood by the wise, nor riches by the shrewd, nor favor by the experts; for a time of misfortune comes to all alike. 
    12: Human beings no more know their own time than fish taken in the fatal net or birds trapped in the snare; like these, mortals are caught when an evil time suddenly falls upon them.
The Uncertain Future and the Sages. 
    13: On the other hand I saw this wise deed under the sun, which I thought magnificent. 
    14: Against a small city with few inhabitants advanced a mighty king, who surrounded it and threw up great siegeworks about it. 
    15: But in the city lived a man who, though poor, was wise, and he delivered it through his wisdom. Yet no one remembered this poor man. 
    16: Though I had said, “Wisdom is better than force,” yet the wisdom of the poor man is despised and his words go unheeded.

    17: 
The quiet words of the wise are better heeded
    than the shout of a ruler of fools.

    18: 
Wisdom is better than weapons of war,
    but one bungler destroys much good.


  Chapter 10.

    1: 
1 
Dead flies corrupt and spoil the perfumer’s oil;
    more weighty than wisdom or wealth is a little folly!

    2: 
The wise heart turns to the right;
    the foolish heart to the left.

    3: Even when walking in the street the fool, lacking understanding, calls everyone a fool.

    4: Should the anger of a ruler burst upon you, do not yield your place; for calmness abates great offenses.

    5: I have seen under the sun another evil, like a mistake that proceeds from a tyrant: 
    6: a fool put in high position, while the great and the rich sit in lowly places. 
    7: I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes went on foot like slaves.

    8: 
Whoever digs a pit may fall into it,
    and whoever breaks through a wall, a snake may bite.

    9: 
    10: 1 
Dead flies corrupt and spoil the perfumer’s oil;
    more weighty than wisdom or wealth is a little folly!
2 
The wise heart turns to the right;
    the foolish heart to the left.[b]
3 Even when walking in the street the fool, lacking understanding, calls everyone a fool.[c]
4 Should the anger of a ruler burst upon you, do not yield your place; for calmness[d] abates great offenses.
5 I have seen under the sun another evil, like a mistake that proceeds from a tyrant: 6 a fool put in high position, while the great and the rich sit in lowly places. 7 I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes[e] went on foot like slaves.
8 
Whoever digs a pit may fall into it,
    and whoever breaks through a wall, a snake may bite.
9 
Whoever quarries stones may be hurt by them,
    and whoever chops wood[f] is in danger from it.
10 If the ax becomes dull, and the blade is not sharpened, then effort must be increased. But the advantage of wisdom is success.

    11: 
If the snake bites before it is charmed,
    then there is no advantage in a charmer.

    12: 
Words from the mouth of the wise win favor,
    but the lips of fools consume them.

    13: 
The beginning of their words is folly,
    and the end of their talk is utter madness;

    14: 
    yet fools multiply words.
No one knows what is to come,
    for who can tell anyone what will be?

    15: 
The toil of fools wearies them,
    so they do not know even the way to town.
No One Knows What Evil Will Come

    16: 
Woe to you, O land, whose king is a youth,
    and whose princes feast in the morning!

    17: 
Happy are you, O land, whose king is of noble birth,
    and whose princes dine at the right time—
    for vigor and not in drinking bouts.

    18: 
Because of laziness, the rafters sag;
    when hands are slack, the house leaks.

    19: 
A feast is made for merriment
    and wine gives joy to the living,
    but money answers for everything.

    20: 
Even in your thoughts do not curse the king,
    nor in the privacy of your bedroom curse the rich;
For the birds of the air may carry your voice,
    a winged creature may tell what you say.


  Chapter 11.

    1: 
1 
Send forth your bread upon the face of the waters;
    after a long time you may find it again.

    2: 
Make seven, or even eight portions;
    you know not what misfortune may come upon the earth.
No One Knows What Good Will Come

    3: 
When the clouds are full,
    they pour out rain upon the earth.
Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north,
    wherever it falls, there shall it lie.

    4: 
One who pays heed to the wind will never sow,
    and one who watches the clouds will never reap.

    5: 
Just as you do not know how the life breath
    enters the human frame in the mother’s womb,
So you do not know the work of God,
    who is working in everything.

    6: 
In the morning sow your seed,
    and at evening do not let your hand be idle:
For you do not know which of the two will be successful,
    or whether both alike will turn out well.
Poem on Youth and Old Age. 
    7: Light is sweet! and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun. 
    8: However many years mortals may live, let them, as they enjoy them all, remember that the days of darkness will be many. All that is to come is vanity.

    9: Rejoice, O youth, while you are young
    and let your heart be glad in the days of your youth.
Follow the ways of your heart,
    the vision of your eyes;
Yet understand regarding all this
    that God will bring you to judgment.

    10: 
    11: 1 
Send forth your bread upon the face of the waters;
    after a long time you may find it again.
2 
Make seven, or even eight portions;
    you know not what misfortune may come upon the earth.
No One Knows What Good Will Come
3 
[b]When the clouds are full,
    they pour out rain upon the earth.
Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north,
    wherever it falls, there shall it lie.
4 
One who pays heed to the wind will never sow,
    and one who watches the clouds will never reap.
5 
Just as you do not know how the life breath
    enters the human frame in the mother’s womb,
So you do not know the work of God,
    who is working in everything.
6 
In the morning sow your seed,
    and at evening do not let your hand be idle:
For you do not know which of the two will be successful,
    or whether both alike will turn out well.
Poem on Youth and Old Age. 7 [c]Light is sweet! and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun. 8 However many years mortals may live, let them, as they enjoy them all, remember that the days of darkness will be many. All that is to come is vanity.
9 
Rejoice, O youth, while you are young
    and let your heart be glad in the days of your youth.
Follow the ways of your heart,
    the vision of your eyes;
Yet understand regarding all this
    that God will bring you to judgment.
10 
Banish misery from your heart
    and remove pain from your body,
    for youth and black hair are fleeting.[d]


  Chapter 12.

    1: 
    2: 1 
Remember your Creator in the days of your youth,
    before the evil days come
And the years approach of which you will say,
    “I have no pleasure in them”;
2 
Before the sun is darkened
    and the light and the moon and the stars
    and the clouds return after the rain;

    3: 
When the guardians of the house tremble,
    and the strong men are bent;
When the women who grind are idle because they are few,
    and those who look through the windows grow blind;

    4: 
When the doors to the street are shut,
    and the sound of the mill is low;
When one rises at the call of a bird,
    and all the daughters of song are quiet;

    5: 
When one is afraid of heights,
    and perils in the street;
When the almond tree blooms,
    and the locust grows sluggish
    and the caper berry is without effect,
Because mortals go to their lasting home,
    and mourners go about the streets;

    6: 
Before the silver cord is snapped
    and the golden bowl is broken,
And the pitcher is shattered at the spring,
    and the pulley is broken at the well,

    7: 
And the dust returns to the earth as it once was,
    and the life breath returns to God who gave it.

    8: 
Vanity of vanities, says Qoheleth,
    all things are vanity!
Epilogue. 
    9: e]Besides being wise, Qoheleth taught the people knowledge, and weighed, scrutinized and arranged many proverbs. 
    10: Qoheleth sought to find appropriate sayings, and to write down true sayings with precision. 
    11: 
    12: 1 
Remember your Creator in the days of your youth,
    before the evil days come
And the years approach of which you will say,
    “I have no pleasure in them”;
2 
Before the sun is darkened
    and the light and the moon and the stars
    and the clouds return after the rain;
3 
[b]When the guardians of the house tremble,
    and the strong men are bent;
When the women who grind are idle because they are few,
    and those who look through the windows grow blind;
4 
When the doors to the street are shut,
    and the sound of the mill is low;
When one rises at the call of a bird,
    and all the daughters of song are quiet;
5 
When one is afraid of heights,
    and perils in the street;
When the almond tree blooms,
    and the locust grows sluggish
    and the caper berry is without effect,
Because mortals go to their lasting home,
    and mourners go about the streets;
6 
[c]Before the silver cord is snapped
    and the golden bowl is broken,
And the pitcher is shattered at the spring,
    and the pulley is broken at the well,
7 
And the dust returns to the earth as it once was,
    and the life breath returns to God who gave it.[d]
8 
Vanity of vanities, says Qoheleth,
    all things are vanity!
Epilogue. 9 [e]Besides being wise, Qoheleth taught the people knowledge, and weighed, scrutinized and arranged many proverbs. 10 Qoheleth sought to find appropriate sayings, and to write down true sayings with precision. 11 The sayings of the wise are like goads; like fixed spikes are the collected sayings given by one shepherd.[f] 12 As to more than these,[g] my son, beware. Of the making of many books there is no end, and in much study there is weariness for the flesh.

    13: The last word, when all is heard: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this concerns all humankind; 
    14: because God will bring to judgment every work, with all its hidden qualities, whether good or bad.
