Day 195:

Reading Wisdom, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: 
Then shall the righteous one with great assurance confront
    his oppressors who set at nought his labors.

    2: 
Seeing this, the wicked shall be shaken with dreadful fear,
    and be amazed at the unexpected salvation.

    3: 
They shall say among themselves, rueful
    and groaning through anguish of spirit:
“This is the one whom once we held as a laughingstock
    and as a type for mockery,

    4: 
    5: 1 
Then shall the righteous one with great assurance confront
    his oppressors who set at nought his labors.
2 
Seeing this, the wicked shall be shaken with dreadful fear,
    and be amazed at the unexpected salvation.
3 
They shall say among themselves, rueful
    and groaning through anguish of spirit:
“This is the one whom once we held as a laughingstock
    and as a type for mockery,
4 
    fools that we were!
His life we accounted madness,
    and death dishonored.
5 
See how he is accounted among the heavenly beings;[b]
    how his lot is with the holy ones!

    6: 
We, then, have strayed from the way of truth,
    and the light of righteousness did not shine for us,
    and the sun did not rise for us.

    7: 
We were entangled in the thorns of mischief and of ruin;
    we journeyed through trackless deserts,
    but the way of the Lord we never knew.

    8: 
What did our pride avail us?
    What have wealth and its boastfulness afforded us?

    9: All of them passed like a shadow
    and like a fleeting rumor;

    10: 
Like a ship traversing the heaving water:
    when it has passed, no trace can be found,
    no path of its keel in the waves.

    11: 
Or like a bird flying through the air;
    no evidence of its course is to be found—
But the fluid air, lashed by the beating of pinions,
    and cleft by the rushing force
Of speeding wings, is traversed;
    and afterward no mark of passage can be found in it.

    12: 
Or as, when an arrow has been shot at a mark,
    the parted air straightway flows together again
    so that none discerns the way it went—

    13: 
Even so, once born, we abruptly came to nought
    and held no sign of virtue to display,
    but were consumed in our wickedness.”

    14: 
Yes, the hope of the wicked is like chaff borne by the wind,
    and like fine, storm-driven snow;
Like smoke scattered by the wind,
    and like the passing memory of the nomad camping for a single day.

    15: 
But the righteous live forever,
    and in the Lord is their recompense,
    and the thought of them is with the Most High.

    16: 
Therefore shall they receive the splendid crown,
    the beautiful diadem, from the hand of the Lord,
For he will shelter them with his right hand,
    and protect them with his arm.

    17: 
He shall take his zeal for armor
    and arm creation to requite the enemy,

    18: 
Shall put on righteousness for a breastplate,
    wear sure judgment for a helmet,

    19: 
Shall take invincible holiness for a shield,

    20: 
    and sharpen his sudden anger for a sword.
The universe will war with him against the foolhardy;

    21: 
Well-aimed bolts of lightning will go forth
    and from the clouds will leap to the mark as from a well-drawn bow;

    22: 
    and as from a sling, wrathful hailstones shall be hurled.
The waters of the sea will be enraged
    and flooding rivers will overwhelm them;

    23: 
A mighty wind will confront them
    and winnow them like a tempest;
Thus lawlessness will lay waste the whole earth
    and evildoing overturn the thrones of the mighty.


  Chapter 6.

    1: 
Hear, therefore, kings, and understand;
    learn, you magistrates of the earth’s expanse!

    2: 
Give ear, you who have power over multitudes
    and lord it over throngs of peoples!

    3: 
Because authority was given you by the Lord
    and sovereignty by the Most High,
    who shall probe your works and scrutinize your counsels!

    4: 
Because, though you were ministers of his kingdom, you did not judge rightly,
    and did not keep the law,
    nor walk according to the will of God,

    5: 
    6: Exhortation to Seek Wisdom
1 
Hear, therefore, kings, and understand;
    learn, you magistrates[b] of the earth’s expanse!
2 
Give ear, you who have power over multitudes
    and lord it over throngs of peoples!
3 
Because authority was given you by the Lord
    and sovereignty by the Most High,
    who shall probe your works and scrutinize your counsels!
4 
Because, though you were ministers of his kingdom, you did not judge rightly,
    and did not keep the law,[c]
    nor walk according to the will of God,
5 
Terribly and swiftly he shall come against you,
    because severe judgment awaits the exalted—
6 
For the lowly may be pardoned out of mercy
    but the mighty shall be mightily put to the test.

    7: 
For the Ruler of all shows no partiality,
    nor does he fear greatness,
Because he himself made the great as well as the small,
    and provides for all alike;

    8: 
    but for those in power a rigorous scrutiny impends.

    9: To you, therefore, O princes, are my words addressed
    that you may learn wisdom and that you may not fall away.

    10: 
For those who keep the holy precepts hallowed will be found holy,
    and those learned in them will have ready a response.

    11: 
Desire therefore my words;
    long for them and you will be instructed.

    12: 
Resplendent and unfading is Wisdom,
    and she is readily perceived by those who love her,
    and found by those who seek her.

    13: 
She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her;

    14: 
    one who watches for her at dawn will not be disappointed,
    for she will be found sitting at the gate.

    15: 
For setting your heart on her is the perfection of prudence,
    and whoever keeps vigil for her is quickly free from care;

    16: 
Because she makes her rounds, seeking those worthy of her,
    and graciously appears to them on the way,
    and goes to meet them with full attention.

    17: 
For the first step toward Wisdom is an earnest desire for discipline;

    18: 
    then, care for discipline is love of her;
    love means the keeping of her laws;
To observe her laws is the basis for incorruptibility;

    19: 
    and incorruptibility makes one close to God;

    20: 
    thus the desire for Wisdom leads to a kingdom.

    21: 
If, then, you find pleasure in throne and scepter, you princes of peoples,
    honor Wisdom, that you may reign as kings forever.
II. Praise of Wisdom by Solomon
Introduction

    22: 
Now what wisdom is, and how she came to be I shall proclaim;
    and I shall conceal no secrets from you,
But from the very beginning I shall search out
    and bring to light knowledge of her;
    I shall not diverge from the truth.

    23: 
Neither shall I admit consuming jealousy to my company,
    because that can have no fellowship with Wisdom.

    24: 
A multitude of the wise is the safety of the world,
    and a prudent king, the stability of the people;

    25: 
    so take instruction from my words, to your profit.


  Chapter 7.

    1: 
I too am a mortal, the same as all the rest,
    and a descendant of the first one formed of earth.
And in my mother’s womb I was molded into flesh

    2: 
    in a ten-month period—body and blood,
    from the seed of a man, and the pleasure that accompanies marriage.

    3: 
And I too, when born, inhaled the common air,
    and fell upon the kindred earth;
    wailing, I uttered that first sound common to all.

    4: 
In swaddling clothes and with constant care I was nurtured.

    5: 
For no king has any different origin or birth;

    6: 
    7: Solomon Is Like All Others
1 
I too am a mortal, the same as all the rest,
    and a descendant of the first one formed of earth.
And in my mother’s womb I was molded into flesh
2 
    in a ten-month period[b]—body and blood,
    from the seed of a man, and the pleasure that accompanies marriage.
3 
And I too, when born, inhaled the common air,
    and fell upon the kindred earth;
    wailing, I uttered that first sound common to all.
4 
In swaddling clothes and with constant care I was nurtured.
5 
For no king has any different origin or birth;
6 
    one is the entry into life for all,
    and in one same way they leave it.
Solomon Prayed and Wisdom and Riches Came to Him
7 
Therefore I prayed, and prudence was given me;
    I pleaded and the spirit of Wisdom came to me.

    8: 
I preferred her to scepter and throne,
And deemed riches nothing in comparison with her,

    9:     nor did I liken any priceless gem to her;
Because all gold, in view of her, is a bit of sand,
    and before her, silver is to be accounted mire.

    10: 
Beyond health and beauty I loved her,
And I chose to have her rather than the light,
    because her radiance never ceases.

    11: 
Yet all good things together came to me with her,
    and countless riches at her hands;

    12: 
I rejoiced in them all, because Wisdom is their leader,
    though I had not known that she is their mother.
Solomon Prays for Help to Speak Worthily of Wisdom

    13: 
Sincerely I learned about her, and ungrudgingly do I share—
    her riches I do not hide away;

    14: 
For she is an unfailing treasure;
    those who gain this treasure win the friendship of God,
    being commended by the gifts that come from her discipline.

    15: 
Now God grant I speak suitably
    and value these endowments at their worth:
For he is the guide of Wisdom
    and the director of the wise.

    16: 
For both we and our words are in his hand,
    as well as all prudence and knowledge of crafts.

    17: 
For he gave me sound knowledge of what exists,
    that I might know the structure of the universe and the force of its elements,

    18: 
The beginning and the end and the midpoint of times,
    the changes in the sun’s course and the variations of the seasons,

    19: 
Cycles of years, positions of stars,

    20: 
    natures of living things, tempers of beasts,
Powers of the winds and thoughts of human beings,
    uses of plants and virtues of roots—

    21: 
Whatever is hidden or plain I learned,

    22: 
    for Wisdom, the artisan of all, taught me.
Nature and Incomparable Dignity of Wisdom
 For in her is a spirit
    intelligent, holy, unique,
Manifold, subtle, agile,
    clear, unstained, certain,
Never harmful, loving the good, keen,

    23: 
    unhampered, beneficent, kindly,
Firm, secure, tranquil,
    all-powerful, all-seeing,
And pervading all spirits,
    though they be intelligent, pure and very subtle.

    24: 
For Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion,
    and she penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity.

    25: 
For she is a breath of the might of God
    and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty;
    therefore nothing defiled can enter into her.

    26: 
For she is the reflection of eternal light,
    the spotless mirror of the power of God,
    the image of his goodness.

    27: 
Although she is one, she can do all things,
    and she renews everything while herself perduring;
Passing into holy souls from age to age,
    she produces friends of God and prophets.

    28: 
For God loves nothing so much as the one who dwells with Wisdom.

    29: 
For she is fairer than the sun
    and surpasses every constellation of the stars.
Compared to light, she is found more radiant;

    30: 
    though night supplants light,
    wickedness does not prevail over Wisdom.


  Chapter 8.

    1: 
Indeed, she spans the world from end to end mightily
    and governs all things well.
Wisdom, the Source of Blessings

    2: 
Her I loved and sought after from my youth;
    I sought to take her for my bride
    and was enamored of her beauty.

    3: 
She adds to nobility the splendor of companionship with God;
    even the Ruler of all loved her.

    4: 
For she leads into the understanding of God,
    and chooses his works.

    5: 
If riches are desirable in life,
    what is richer than Wisdom, who produces all things?

    6: 
And if prudence is at work,
    who in the world is a better artisan than she?

    7: 
    8: 1 
Indeed, she spans the world from end to end mightily
    and governs all things well.
Wisdom, the Source of Blessings
2 
Her I loved and sought after from my youth;
    I sought to take her for my bride
    and was enamored of her beauty.
3 
She adds to nobility the splendor of companionship with God;
    even the Ruler of all loved her.
4 
For she leads into the understanding of God,
    and chooses his works.
5 
If riches are desirable in life,
    what is richer than Wisdom, who produces all things?
6 
And if prudence is at work,
    who in the world is a better artisan than she?
7 
Or if one loves righteousness,
    whose works are virtues,
She teaches moderation and prudence,
    righteousness and fortitude,[b]
    and nothing in life is more useful than these.
8 
Or again, if one yearns for wide experience,
    she knows the things of old, and infers the things to come.
She understands the turns of phrases and the solutions of riddles;
    signs and wonders she knows in advance
    and the outcome of times and ages.
Wisdom as Solomon’s Counselor and Comfort

    9: So I determined to take her to live with me,
    knowing that she would be my counselor while all was well,
    and my comfort in care and grief.

    10: 
Because of her I have glory among the multitudes,
    and esteem from the elders, though I am but a youth.

    11: 
I shall become keen in judgment,
    and shall be a marvel before rulers.

    12: 
They will wait while I am silent and listen when I speak;
    and when I shall speak the more,
    they will put their hands upon their mouths.

    13: 
Because of her I shall have immortality
    and leave to those after me an everlasting memory.

    14: 
I shall govern peoples, and nations will be my subjects—

    15: 
    tyrannical princes, hearing of me, will be afraid;
    in the assembly I shall appear noble, and in war courageous.

    16: 
Entering my house, I shall take my repose beside her;
For association with her involves no bitterness
    and living with her no grief,
    but rather joy and gladness.
Wisdom Is a Gift of God

    17: 
Reflecting on these things,
    and considering in my heart
That immortality lies in kinship with Wisdom,

    18: 
    great delight in love of her,
    and unfailing riches in the works of her hands;
And that in associating with her there is prudence,
    and fair renown in sharing her discourses,
    I went about seeking to take her for my own.

    19: 
Now, I was a well-favored child,
    and I came by a noble nature;

    20: 
    or rather, being noble, I attained an unblemished body.

    21: 
And knowing that I could not otherwise possess her unless God gave it—
    and this, too, was prudence, to know whose gift she is—
I went to the Lord and besought him,
    and said with all my heart:
