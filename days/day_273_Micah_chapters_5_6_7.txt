Day 273:

Reading Micah, chapters ['5', '6', '7']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: 
But you, Bethlehem-Ephrathah
    least among the clans of Judah,
From you shall come forth for me
    one who is to be ruler in Israel;
Whose origin is from of old,
    from ancient times.

    2: 
Therefore the Lord will give them up, until the time
    when she who is to give birth has borne,
Then the rest of his kindred shall return
    to the children of Israel.

    3: 
He shall take his place as shepherd
    by the strength of the Lord,
    by the majestic name of the Lord, his God;
And they shall dwell securely, for now his greatness
    shall reach to the ends of the earth:

    4: 
    5: 1 
But you, Bethlehem-Ephrathah
    least among the clans of Judah,
From you shall come forth for me
    one who is to be ruler in Israel;
Whose origin is from of old,
    from ancient times.
2 
Therefore the Lord will give them up, until the time
    when she who is to give birth has borne,[b]
Then the rest of his kindred shall return
    to the children of Israel.
3 
He shall take his place as shepherd
    by the strength of the Lord,
    by the majestic name of the Lord, his God;
And they shall dwell securely, for now his greatness
    shall reach to the ends of the earth:
4 
    he shall be peace.[c]
If Assyria invades our country
    and treads upon our land,
We shall raise against it seven shepherds,
    eight of royal standing;
5 
They shall tend the land of Assyria with the sword,
    and the land of Nimrod[d] with the drawn sword;
They will deliver us from Assyria,
    when it invades our land,
    when it treads upon our borders.

    6: 
The remnant of Jacob shall be
    in the midst of many peoples,
Like dew coming from the Lord,
    like showers on the grass,
Which wait for no one,
    delay for no human being.

    7: 
And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations,
    in the midst of many peoples,
Like a lion among beasts of the forest,
    like a young lion among flocks of sheep;
When it passes through it tramples;
    it tears and no one can rescue.

    8: 
Your hand shall be lifted above your foes,
    and all your enemies shall be cut down.

    9:     On that day—oracle of the Lord—
I will destroy the horses from your midst
    and ruin your chariots;

    10: 
I will destroy the cities of your land
    and tear down all your fortresses.

    11: 
I will destroy the sorcery you practice,
    and there shall no longer be soothsayers among you.

    12: 
I will destroy your carved figures
    and the sacred stones from your midst;
And you shall no longer worship
    the works of your hands.

    13: 
I will tear out the asherahs from your midst,
    and destroy your cities.

    14: 
I will wreak vengeance in anger and wrath
    upon the nations that have not listened.


  Chapter 6.

    1: 
    Hear, then, what the Lord says:
Arise, plead your case before the mountains,
    and let the hills hear your voice!

    2: 
Hear, O mountains, the Lord’s case,
    pay attention, O foundations of the earth!
For the Lord has a case against his people;
    he enters into trial with Israel.

    3: 
My people, what have I done to you?
    how have I wearied you? Answer me!

    4: 
I brought you up from the land of Egypt,
    from the place of slavery I ransomed you;
And I sent before you Moses,
    Aaron, and Miriam.

    5: 
    6: 1 
    Hear, then, what the Lord says:
Arise, plead your case before the mountains,
    and let the hills hear your voice!
2 
Hear, O mountains, the Lord’s case,
    pay attention, O foundations of the earth!
For the Lord has a case against his people;
    he enters into trial with Israel.
3 
My people, what have I done to you?
    how have I wearied you? Answer me!
4 
I brought you up from the land of Egypt,
    from the place of slavery I ransomed you;
And I sent before you Moses,
    Aaron, and Miriam.
5 
[b]My people, remember what Moab’s King Balak planned,
    and how Balaam, the son of Beor, answered him.
Recall the passage from Shittim to Gilgal,
    that you may know the just deeds of the Lord.
6 
[c]With what shall I come before the Lord,
    and bow before God most high?
Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
    with calves a year old?

    7: 
Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams,
    with myriad streams of oil?
 Shall I give my firstborn for my crime,
    the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

    8: 
You have been told, O mortal, what is good,
    and what the Lord requires of you:
Only to do justice and to love goodness,
    and to walk humbly with your God.

    9: The Lord cries aloud to the city
    (It is prudent to fear your name!):
    Hear, O tribe and city assembly,

    10: 
Am I to bear criminal hoarding
    and the accursed short ephah?

    11: 
Shall I acquit crooked scales,
    bags of false weights?

    12: 
You whose wealthy are full of violence,
    whose inhabitants speak falsehood
    with deceitful tongues in their mouths!

    13: 
I have begun to strike you
    with devastation because of your sins.

    14: 
You shall eat, without being satisfied,
    food that will leave you empty;
What you acquire, you cannot save;
    what you do save, I will deliver up to the sword.

    15: 
You shall sow, yet not reap,
    tread out the olive, yet pour no oil,
    crush the grapes, yet drink no wine.

    16: 
You have kept the decrees of Omri,
    and all the works of the house of Ahab,
    and you have walked in their counsels;
Therefore I will deliver you up to ruin,
    and your citizens to derision;
    and you shall bear the reproach of the nations.


  Chapter 7.

    1: 
Woe is me! I am like the one who gathers summer fruit,
    when the vines have been gleaned;
There is no cluster to eat,
    no early fig that I crave.

    2: 
The faithful have vanished from the earth,
    no mortal is just!
They all lie in wait to shed blood,
    each one ensnares the other.

    3: 
Their hands succeed at evil;
    the prince makes demands,
The judge is bought for a price,
    the powerful speak as they please.

    4: 
The best of them is like a brier,
    the most honest like a thorn hedge.
The day announced by your sentinels!
    Your punishment has come;
    now is the time of your confusion.

    5: 
Put no faith in a friend,
    do not trust a companion;
With her who lies in your embrace
    watch what you say.

    6: 
    7: 1 
Woe is me! I am like the one who gathers summer fruit,
    when the vines have been gleaned;
There is no cluster to eat,
    no early fig that I crave.
2 
The faithful have vanished from the earth,
    no mortal is just!
They all lie in wait to shed blood,
    each one ensnares the other.
3 
Their hands succeed at evil;
    the prince makes demands,
The judge is bought for a price,
    the powerful speak as they please.
4 
The best of them is like a brier,
    the most honest like a thorn hedge.
The day announced by your sentinels!
    Your punishment has come;
    now is the time of your confusion.
5 
Put no faith in a friend,
    do not trust a companion;
With her who lies in your embrace
    watch what you say.
6 
For the son belittles his father,
    the daughter rises up against her mother,
The daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law,
    and your enemies are members of your household.
IV. Confidence in God’s Future
7 
But as for me, I will look to the Lord,
    I will wait for God my savior;
    my God will hear me!

    8: 
Do not rejoice over me, my enemy![b]
    though I have fallen, I will arise;
    though I sit in darkness, the Lord is my light.

    9: I will endure the wrath of the Lord
    because I have sinned against him,
Until he pleads my case,
    and establishes my right.
He will bring me forth to the light;
    I will see his righteousness.

    10: 
When my enemy sees this,
    shame shall cover her:
She who said to me,
    “Where is the Lord, your God?”
My eyes shall see her downfall;
    now she will be trampled underfoot,
    like mud in the streets.

    11: 
It is the day for building your walls;
    on that day your boundaries shall be enlarged.

    12: 
It is the day when those from Assyria to Egypt
    shall come to you,
And from Tyre even to the River,
    from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain;

    13: 
And the earth shall be a waste
    because of its inhabitants,
    as a result of their deeds.

    14: 
Shepherd your people with your staff,
    the flock of your heritage,
That lives apart in a woodland,
    in the midst of an orchard.
Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead,
    as in the days of old;

    15: 
As in the days when you came from the land of Egypt,
    show us wonderful signs.

    16: 
The nations will see and will be put to shame,
    in spite of all their strength;
They will put their hands over their mouths;
    their ears will become deaf.

    17: 
They will lick the dust like a snake,
    like crawling things on the ground;
They will come quaking from their strongholds;
    they will tremble in fear of you, the Lord, our God.

    18: 
Who is a God like you, who removes guilt
    and pardons sin for the remnant of his inheritance;
Who does not persist in anger forever,
    but instead delights in mercy,

    19: 
And will again have compassion on us,
    treading underfoot our iniquities?
You will cast into the depths of the sea all our sins;

    20: 
You will show faithfulness to Jacob,
    and loyalty to Abraham,
As you have sworn to our ancestors
    from days of old.
