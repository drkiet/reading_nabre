Day 133:

Reading Job, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: 
Call now! Will anyone respond to you?
    To which of the holy ones will you turn?

    2: 
Surely impatience kills the fool
    and indignation slays the simpleton.

    3: 
I have seen a fool spreading his roots,
    but I cursed his household suddenly:

    4: 
    5: 1 
Call now! Will anyone respond to you?
    To which of the holy ones will you turn?
2 
Surely impatience kills the fool
    and indignation slays the simpleton.
3 
I have seen a fool spreading his roots,
    but I cursed his household suddenly:
4 
May his children be far from safety;
    may they be crushed at the gate[b] without a rescuer.
5 
What they have reaped may the hungry eat up,
    or God take away by blight,
    or the thirsty swallow their substance.

    6: 
For not from dust does mischief come,
    nor from the soil does trouble sprout.

    7: 
Human beings beget mischief
    as sparks fly upward.

    8: 
In your place, I would appeal to God,
    and to God I would state my plea.

    9: He does things great and unsearchable,
    things marvelous and innumerable.

    10: 
He gives rain upon the earth
    and sends water upon the fields;

    11: 
He sets up the lowly on high,
    and those who mourn are raised to safety.

    12: 
He frustrates the plans of the cunning,
    so that their hands achieve no success;

    13: 
He catches the wise in their own ruses,
    and the designs of the crafty are routed.

    14: 
They meet with darkness in the daytime,
    at noonday they grope as though it were night.

    15: 
But he saves the poor from the sword of their mouth,
    from the hand of the mighty.

    16: 
Thus the needy have hope,
    and iniquity closes its mouth.

    17: 
Happy the one whom God reproves!
    The Almighty’s discipline do not reject.

    18: 
For he wounds, but he binds up;
    he strikes, but his hands give healing.

    19: 
Out of six troubles he will deliver you,
    and at the seventh no evil shall touch you.

    20: 
In famine he will deliver you from death,
    and in war from the power of the sword;

    21: 
From the scourge of the tongue you shall be hidden,
    and you shall not fear approaching ruin.

    22: 
At ruin and want you shall laugh;
    the beasts of the earth, do not fear.

    23: 
With the stones of the field shall your covenant be,
    and the wild beasts shall be at peace with you.

    24: 
And you shall know that your tent is secure;
    taking stock of your household, you shall miss nothing.

    25: 
You shall know that your descendants are many,
    and your offspring like the grass of the earth.

    26: 
You shall approach the grave in full vigor,
    as a shock of grain comes in at its season.

    27: 
See, this we have searched out; so it is!
    This we have heard, and you should know.


  Chapter 6.

    1: Then Job answered and said:

    2: 
Ah, could my anguish but be measured
    and my calamity laid with it in the scales,

    3: 
They would now outweigh the sands of the sea!
    Because of this I speak without restraint.

    4: 
For the arrows of the Almighty are in me,
    and my spirit drinks in their poison;
    the terrors of God are arrayed against me.

    5: 
    6: Job’s First Reply. 1 Then Job answered and said:
2 
Ah, could my anguish but be measured
    and my calamity laid with it in the scales,
3 
They would now outweigh the sands of the sea!
    Because of this I speak without restraint.
4 
For the arrows of the Almighty are in me,
    and my spirit drinks in their poison;
    the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
5 
Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass?
    Does the ox low over its fodder?
6 
Can anything insipid be eaten without salt?
    Is there flavor in the white of an egg?

    7: 
I refuse to touch them;
    they are like loathsome food to me.

    8: 
Oh, that I might have my request,
    and that God would grant what I long for:

    9: Even that God would decide to crush me,
    that he would put forth his hand and cut me off!

    10: 
Then I should still have consolation
    and could exult through unremitting pain,
    because I have not transgressed the commands of the Holy One.

    11: 
What strength have I that I should endure,
    and what is my limit that I should be patient?

    12: 
Have I the strength of stones,
    or is my flesh of bronze?

    13: 
Have I no helper,
    and has my good sense deserted me?

    14: 
A friend owes kindness to one in despair,
    though he has forsaken the fear of the Almighty.

    15: 
My companions are undependable as a wadi,
    as watercourses that run dry in the wadies;

    16: 
Though they may be black with ice,
    and with snow heaped upon them,

    17: 
Yet once they flow, they cease to be;
    in the heat, they disappear from their place.

    18: 
Caravans wander from their routes;
    they go into the wasteland and perish.

    19: 
The caravans of Tema search,
    the companies of Sheba have hopes;

    20: 
They are disappointed, though they were confident;
    they come there and are frustrated.

    21: 
It is thus that you have now become for me;
    you see a terrifying thing and are afraid.

    22: 
Have I said, “Give me something,
    make a bribe on my behalf from your possessions”?

    23: 
Or “Deliver me from the hand of the enemy,
    redeem me from oppressors”?

    24: 
Teach me, and I will be silent;
    make me understand how I have erred.

    25: 
How painful honest words can be;
    yet how unconvincing is your argument!

    26: 
Do you consider your words as proof,
    but the sayings of a desperate man as wind?

    27: 
You would even cast lots for the orphan,
    and would barter over your friend!

    28: 
Come, now, give me your attention;
    surely I will not lie to your face.

    29: 
Think it over; let there be no injustice.
    Think it over; I still am right.

    30: 
Is there insincerity on my tongue,
    or cannot my taste discern falsehood?


  Chapter 7.

    1: 
Is not life on earth a drudgery,
    its days like those of a hireling?

    2: 
Like a slave who longs for the shade,
    a hireling who waits for wages,

    3: 
So I have been assigned months of futility,
    and troubled nights have been counted off for me.

    4: 
When I lie down I say, “When shall I arise?”
    then the night drags on;
    I am filled with restlessness until the dawn.

    5: 
My flesh is clothed with worms and scabs;
    my skin cracks and festers;

    6: 
    7: 1 
Is not life on earth a drudgery,
    its days like those of a hireling?
2 
Like a slave who longs for the shade,
    a hireling who waits for wages,
3 
So I have been assigned months of futility,
    and troubled nights have been counted off for me.
4 
When I lie down I say, “When shall I arise?”
    then the night drags on;
    I am filled with restlessness until the dawn.
5 
My flesh is clothed with worms and scabs;
    my skin cracks and festers;
6 
My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle;
    they come to an end without hope.
7 
Remember that my life is like the wind;
    my eye will not see happiness again.

    8: 
The eye that now sees me shall no more behold me;
    when your eye is on me, I shall be gone.

    9: As a cloud dissolves and vanishes,
    so whoever goes down to Sheol shall not come up.

    10: 
They shall not return home again;
    their place shall know them no more.

    11: 
My own utterance I will not restrain;
    I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
    I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

    12: 
Am I the Sea, or the dragon,
    that you place a watch over me?[c]

    13: 
When I say, “My bed shall comfort me,
    my couch shall ease my complaint,”

    14: 
Then you frighten me with dreams
    and terrify me with visions,

    15: 
So that I should prefer strangulation
    and death rather than my existence.

    16: 
I waste away: I will not live forever;
    let me alone, for my days are but a breath.

    17: 
What are human beings, that you make much of them,
    or pay them any heed?

    18: 
You observe them every morning
    and try them at every moment!

    19: 
How long before you look away from me,
    and let me alone till I swallow my spit?

    20: 
If I sin, what do I do to you,
    O watcher of mortals?
Why have you made me your target?
    Why should I be a burden for you?

    21: 
Why do you not pardon my offense,
    or take away my guilt?
For soon I shall lie down in the dust;
    and should you seek me I shall be gone.


  Chapter 8.

    1: Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:

    2: 
How long will you utter such things?
    The words from your mouth are a mighty wind!

    3: 
Does God pervert judgment,
    does the Almighty pervert justice?

    4: 
If your children have sinned against him
    and he has left them in the grip of their guilt,

    5: 
Still, if you yourself have recourse to God
    and make supplication to the Almighty,

    6: 
Should you be blameless and upright,
    surely now he will rouse himself for you
    and restore your rightful home.

    7: 
    8: Bildad’s First Speech. 1 Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
2 
How long will you utter such things?
    The words from your mouth are a mighty wind!
3 
Does God pervert judgment,
    does the Almighty pervert justice?
4 
If your children have sinned against him
    and he has left them in the grip of their guilt,
5 
Still, if you yourself have recourse to God
    and make supplication to the Almighty,
6 
Should you be blameless and upright,
    surely now he will rouse himself for you
    and restore your rightful home.
7 
Though your beginning was small,
    your future will flourish indeed.
8 
Inquire of the former generations,
    pay attention to the experience of their ancestors—

    9: As we are but of yesterday and have no knowledge,
    because our days on earth are but a shadow—

    10: 
Will they not teach you and tell you
    and utter their words of understanding?

    11: 
Can the papyrus grow up without mire?
    Can the reed grass flourish without water?

    12: 
While it is yet green and uncut,
    it withers quicker than any grass.

    13: 
So is the end of everyone who forgets God,
    and so shall the hope of the godless perish.

    14: 
His confidence is but a gossamer thread,
    his trust is a spider’s house.

    15: 
He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand;
    he shall cling to it, but it shall not endure.

    16: 
He thrives in full sun,
    and over his garden his shoots go forth;

    17: 
About a heap of stones his roots are entwined;
    among the rocks he takes hold.

    18: 
Yet if one tears him from his place,
    it will disown him: “I have never seen you!”

    19: 
There he lies rotting beside the road,
    and out of the soil another sprouts.

    20: 
Behold, God will not cast away the upright;
    neither will he take the hand of the wicked.

    21: 
Once more will he fill your mouth with laughter
    and your lips with rejoicing.

    22: 
Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame,
    and the tent of the wicked shall be no more.
