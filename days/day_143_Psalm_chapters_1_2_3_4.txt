Day 143:

Reading Psalm, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: 41
Psalm 1
True Happiness in God’s Law
I
1 
Blessed is the man who does not walk
    in the counsel of the wicked,
Nor stand in the way[b] of sinners,
    nor sit in company with scoffers.

    2: 
Rather, the law of the Lord is his joy;
    and on his law he meditates day and night.

    3: 
    4: 
Psalm 1
True Happiness in God’s Law
I
1 
Blessed is the man who does not walk
    in the counsel of the wicked,
Nor stand in the way[b] of sinners,
    nor sit in company with scoffers.
2 
Rather, the law of the Lord[c] is his joy;
    and on his law he meditates day and night.
3 
He is like a tree
    planted near streams of water,
    that yields its fruit in season;
Its leaves never wither;
    whatever he does prospers.
II
4 
But not so are the wicked,[d] not so!
    They are like chaff driven by the wind.

    5: 
Therefore the wicked will not arise at the judgment,
    nor will sinners in the assembly of the just.

    6: 
Because the Lord knows the way of the just,
    but the way of the wicked leads to ruin.


  Chapter 2.

    1: 
    2: a]
A Psalm for a Royal Coronation
1 
Why do the nations protest
    and the peoples conspire in vain?
2 
Kings on earth rise up
    and princes plot together
    against the Lord and against his anointed one:[b]

    3: 
“Let us break their shackles
    and cast off their chains from us!”

    4: 
The one enthroned in heaven laughs;
    the Lord derides them,

    5: 
Then he speaks to them in his anger,
    in his wrath he terrifies them:

    6: 
“I myself have installed my king
    on Zion, my holy mountain.”

    7: 
I will proclaim the decree of the Lord,
    he said to me, “You are my son;
    today I have begotten you.

    8: 
Ask it of me,
    and I will give you the nations as your inheritance,
    and, as your possession, the ends of the earth.

    9: With an iron rod you will shepherd them,
    like a potter’s vessel you will shatter them.”

    10: 
And now, kings, give heed;
    take warning, judges on earth.

    11: 
Serve the Lord with fear;
    exult with trembling,
Accept correction
    lest he become angry and you perish along the way
    when his anger suddenly blazes up.
Blessed are all who take refuge in him!

    arrayed against me on every side.
III

    8: 
Arise, Lord! Save me, my God!

    May your blessing be upon your people!

    and trust in the Lord.

Many say, “May we see better times!

    than they have when grain and wine abound.

    for you alone, Lord, make me secure.
