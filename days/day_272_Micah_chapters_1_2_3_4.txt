Day 272:

Reading Micah, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: 1 The word of the Lord which came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
I. Oracles of Punishment

    2: 
Hear, O peoples, all of you,
    give heed, O earth, and all that is in it!
Let the Lord God be witness against you,
    the Lord from his holy temple!

    3: 
For see, the Lord goes out from his place
    and descending, treads upon the heights of the earth.

    4: 
The mountains melt under him
    and the valleys split open,
Like wax before the fire,
    like water poured down a slope.

    5: 
All this is for the crime of Jacob,
    for the sins of the house of Israel.
What is the crime of Jacob? Is it not Samaria?
And what is the sin of the house of Judah?
    Is it not Jerusalem?

    6: 
So I will make Samaria a ruin in the field,
    a place to plant vineyards;
I will throw its stones into the valley,
    and lay bare its foundations.

    7: 
All its carved figures shall be broken to pieces,
    all its wages shall be burned in the fire,
    and all its idols I will destroy.
As the wages of a prostitute it gathered them,
    and to the wages of a prostitute they shall return.

    8: 
For this I will lament and wail,
    go barefoot and naked;
I will utter lamentation like the jackals,
    mourning like the ostriches,

    9: For her wound is incurable;
    it has come even to Judah.
It has reached to the gate of my people,
    even to Jerusalem.

    10: 
Do not announce it in Gath,
    do not weep at all;
In Beth-leaphrah
    roll in the dust.

    11: 
Pass by,
    you who dwell in Shaphir!
The inhabitants of Zaanan
    do not come forth from their city.
There is lamentation in Beth-ezel.
    It will withdraw its support from you.

    12: 
The inhabitants of Maroth
    hope for good,
But evil has come down from the Lord
    to the gate of Jerusalem.

    13: 
Harness steeds to the chariots,
    inhabitants of Lachish;
You are the beginning of sin
    for daughter Zion,
For in you were found
    the crimes of Israel.

    14: 
Therefore you must give back the dowry
    to Moresheth-gath;
The houses of Achzib are a dry stream bed
    to the kings of Israel.

    15: 
Again I will bring the conqueror to you,
    inhabitants of Mareshah;
The glory of Israel shall come
    even to Adullam.

    16: 
Make yourself bald, cut off your hair,
    for the children whom you cherish;
Make yourself bald as a vulture,
    for they are taken from you into exile.


  Chapter 2.

    1: 
    2: 1 
Ah! you plotters of iniquity,
    who work out evil on your beds!
In the morning light you carry it out
    for it lies within your power.
2 
[b]You covet fields, and seize them;
    houses, and take them;
You cheat owners of their houses,
    people of their inheritance.

    3: 
    Therefore thus says the Lord:
Look, I am planning against this family an evil
    from which you cannot free your necks;
Nor shall you walk with head held high,
    for it will be an evil time.

    4: 
On that day you shall be mocked,
    and there will be bitter lament:
“Our ruin is complete,
    our fields are divided among our captors,
The fields of my people are measured out,
    and no one can get them back!”

    5: 
Thus you shall have no one
    in the assembly of the Lord
    to allot to you a share of land.

    6: 
“Do not preach,” they preach,
    “no one should preach of these things!
    Shame will not overtake us.”

    7: 
How can it be said, house of Jacob,
    “Is the Lord short of patience;
    are these the Lord’s deeds?”
Do not my words promise good
    to the one who walks in justice?

    8: 
But you rise up against my people as an enemy:
    you have stripped off the garment from the peaceful,
From those who go their way in confidence,
    as though it were spoils of war.

    9: The women of my people you drive out
    from their pleasant houses;
From their children you take away
    forever the honor I gave them.

    10: 
“Get up! Leave,
    this is no place to rest”;
Because of uncleanness that destroys
    with terrible destruction.

    11: 
If one possessed of a lying spirit
    speaks deceitfully, saying,
“I will preach to you wine and strong drink,”
    that one would be the preacher for this people.

    12: 
I will gather you, Jacob, each and every one,
    I will assemble all the remnant of Israel;
I will group them like a flock in the fold,
    like a herd in its pasture;
    the noise of the people will resound.

    13: 
The one who makes a breach goes up before them;
    they make a breach and pass through the gate;
Their king shall go through before them,
    the Lord at their head.


  Chapter 3.

    1: 
    And I said:
Hear, you leaders of Jacob,
    rulers of the house of Israel!
Is it not your duty to know what is right,

    2: 
    3: 1 
    And I said:
Hear, you leaders of Jacob,
    rulers of the house of Israel!
Is it not your duty to know what is right,
2 
    you who hate what is good, and love evil?
You who tear their skin from them,
    and their flesh from their bones;
3 
Who eat the flesh of my people,
    flay their skin from them,
    and break their bones;
Who chop them in pieces like flesh in a kettle,
    like meat in a pot.

    4: 
When they cry to the Lord,
    he will not answer them;
He will hide his face from them at that time,
    because of the evil they have done.

    5: 
Thus says the Lord regarding the prophets:
    O you who lead my people astray,
When your teeth have something to bite
    you announce peace,
But proclaim war against the one
    who fails to put something in your mouth.

    6: 
Therefore you shall have night, not vision,
    darkness, not divination;
The sun shall go down upon the prophets,
    and the day shall be dark for them.

    7: 
Then the seers shall be put to shame,
    and the diviners confounded;
They shall all cover their lips,
    because there is no answer from God.

    8: 
But as for me, I am filled with power,
    with the spirit of the Lord,
    with justice and with might;
To declare to Jacob his crimes
    and to Israel his sins.

    9: Hear this, you leaders of the house of Jacob,
    you rulers of the house of Israel!
You who abhor justice,
    and pervert all that is right;

    10: 
Who build up Zion with bloodshed,
    and Jerusalem with wickedness!

    11: 
Its leaders render judgment for a bribe,
    the priests teach for pay,
    the prophets divine for money,
While they rely on the Lord, saying,
    “Is not the Lord in the midst of us?
    No evil can come upon us!”

    12: 
Therefore, because of you,
    Zion shall be plowed like a field,
    and Jerusalem reduced to rubble,
And the mount of the temple
    to a forest ridge.


  Chapter 4.

    1: 
In days to come
    the mount of the Lord’s house
Shall be established as the highest mountain;
    it shall be raised above the hills,
And peoples shall stream to it:

    2: 
    Many nations shall come, and say,
“Come, let us climb the Lord’s mountain,
    to the house of the God of Jacob,
That he may instruct us in his ways,
    that we may walk in his paths.”
For from Zion shall go forth instruction,
    and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

    3: 
    4: 1 
In days to come
    the mount of the Lord’s house
Shall be established as the highest mountain;
    it shall be raised above the hills,
And peoples shall stream to it:
2 
    Many nations shall come, and say,
“Come, let us climb the Lord’s mountain,
    to the house of the God of Jacob,
That he may instruct us in his ways,
    that we may walk in his paths.”
For from Zion shall go forth instruction,
    and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
3 
He shall judge between many peoples
    and set terms for strong and distant nations;
They shall beat their swords into plowshares,
    and their spears into pruning hooks;
One nation shall not raise the sword against another,
    nor shall they train for war again.
4 
They shall all sit under their own vines,
    under their own fig trees, undisturbed;
    for the Lord of hosts has spoken.

    5: 
Though all the peoples walk,
    each in the name of its god,
We will walk in the name of the Lord,
    our God, forever and ever.

    6: 
On that day—oracle of the Lord—
    I will gather the lame,
And I will assemble the outcasts,
    and those whom I have afflicted.

    7: 
I will make of the lame a remnant,
    and of the weak a strong nation;
The Lord shall be king over them on Mount Zion,
    from now on and forever.

    8: 
And you, O tower of the flock,
    hill of daughter Zion!
To you it shall come:
    the former dominion shall be restored,
    the reign of daughter Jerusalem.

    9: Now why do you cry out so?
    Are you without a king?
    Or has your adviser perished,
That you are seized with pains
    like a woman in labor?

    10: 
Writhe, go into labor,
    O daughter Zion,
    like a woman giving birth;
For now you shall leave the city
    and camp in the fields;
To Babylon you shall go,
    there you shall be rescued.
There the Lord shall redeem you
    from the hand of your enemies.

    11: 
And now many nations are gathered against you!
    They say, “Let her be profaned,
    let our eyes see Zion’s downfall!”

    12: 
But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord,
    nor understand his plan:
He has gathered them
    like sheaves to the threshing floor.

    13: 
Arise and thresh, O daughter Zion;
    your horn I will make iron
And your hoofs I will make bronze,
    that you may crush many peoples;
You shall devote their spoils to the Lord,
    their riches to the Lord of the whole earth.

    14: 
Now grieve, O grieving daughter!
    “They have laid siege against us!”
With the rod they strike on the cheek
    the ruler of Israel.
