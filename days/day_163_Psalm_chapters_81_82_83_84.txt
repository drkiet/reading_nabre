I

    2: 
Sing joyfully to God our strength;
    raise loud shouts to the God of Jacob!

    3: 
Take up a melody, sound the timbrel,
    the pleasant lyre with a harp.

    4: 
Blow the shofar at the new moon,
    at the full moon, on our solemn feast.

    5: 
For this is a law for Israel,
    an edict of the God of Jacob,

    6: 
He made it a decree for Joseph
    when he came out of the land of Egypt.

7 
[d]I heard a tongue I did not know:
    “I removed his shoulder from the burden;[e]
    his hands moved away from the basket.
8 
In distress you called and I rescued you;
    I answered you in secret with thunder;
At the waters of Meribah[f] I tested you: 
    9: Listen, my people, I will testify against you
Selah
    If only you will listen to me, Israel!

    10: 
There shall be no foreign god among you;
    you shall not bow down to an alien god.

    11: 
‘I am the Lord your God,
    who brought you up from the land of Egypt.
    Open wide your mouth that I may fill it.’

    12: 
But my people did not listen to my words;
    Israel would not submit to me.

    13: 
So I thrust them away to the hardness of their heart;
    ‘Let them walk in their own machinations.’

    14: 
O that my people would listen to me,
    that Israel would walk in my ways,

    15: 
In a moment I would humble their foes,
    and turn back my hand against their oppressors.

    16: 
Those who hate the Lord will try flattering him,
    but their fate is fixed forever.

    17: 
But Israel I will feed with the finest wheat,
    I will satisfy them with honey from the rock.”

    render justice to the afflicted and needy.

    4: 
Rescue the lowly and poor;
    deliver them from the hand of the wicked.”
II

    5: 
The gods neither know nor understand,
    wandering about in darkness,
    and all the world’s foundations shake.

    6: 
I declare: “Gods though you be,
    offspring of the Most High all of you,

7 
Yet like any mortal you shall die;
    like any prince you shall fall.”

    3: a]
Prayer Against a Hostile Alliance
1 A song; a psalm of Asaph.
I
2 
God, do not be silent;
    God, do not be deaf or remain unmoved!
3 
See how your enemies rage;
    your foes proudly raise their heads.

    4: 
They conspire against your people,
    plot against those you protect.

    5: 
They say, “Come, let us wipe them out as a nation;
    let Israel’s name be remembered no more!”

    6: 
They scheme with one mind,
    they have entered into a covenant against you:

6 
They scheme with one mind,
    they have entered into a covenant against you:
7 
[b]The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
    of Moab and the Hagrites,
8 
Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,
    Philistia and the inhabitants of Tyre.

    9: Assyria, too, in league with them,
    backs the descendants of Lot.
Selah
II

    10: 
Deal with them as with Midian;
    as with Sisera and Jabin at the wadi Kishon,

    11: 
Those destroyed at Endor,
    who became dung for the ground.

    12: 
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
    all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,

    13: 
Who made a plan together,
    “Let us take for ourselves the pastures of God.”

    14: 
My God, make them like tumbleweed,
    into chaff flying before the wind.

    15: 
As a fire raging through a forest,
    a flame setting mountains ablaze,

    16: 
Pursue them with your tempest;
    terrify them with your storm-wind.

    17: 
Cover their faces with shame,
    till they seek your name, Lord.

    18: 
Let them be ashamed and terrified forever;
    let them perish in disgrace.

    19: 
Let them know that your name is Lord,
    you alone are the Most High over all the earth.

4 
[b]As the sparrow finds a home

They will go from strength to strength[d]
    and see the God of gods on Zion.

O God, watch over our shield;

IV

    11: 
Better one day in your courts
    than a thousand elsewhere.
Better the threshold of the house of my God
    than a home in the tents of the wicked.

    12: 
For a sun and shield is the Lord God,
    bestowing all grace and glory.
The Lord withholds no good thing
    from those who walk without reproach.

    13: 
O Lord of hosts,
    blessed the man who trusts in you!
