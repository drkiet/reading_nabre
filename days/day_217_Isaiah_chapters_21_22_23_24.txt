Day 217:

Reading Isaiah, chapters ['21', '22', '23', '24']:

  Chapter 21.

    1: 
    2: 
Fall of Babylon
1 
    Oracle on the wastelands by the sea:[b]
Like whirlwinds sweeping through the Negeb,
    it comes from the desert,
    from the fearful land.
2 
A harsh vision has been announced to me:
    “The traitor betrays,
    the despoiler spoils.
Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media;[c]
    put an end to all its groaning!”

    3: 
Therefore my loins are filled with anguish,
    pangs have seized me like those of a woman in labor;
I am too bewildered to hear,
    too dismayed to look.

    4: 
My mind reels,
    shuddering assails me;
The twilight I yearned for
    he has turned into dread.

    5: 
They set the table,
    spread out the rugs;
    they eat, they drink.
Rise up, O princes,
    oil the shield!

    6: 
For thus my Lord said to me:
    Go, station a watchman,
    let him tell what he sees.

    7: 
If he sees a chariot,
    a pair of horses,
Someone riding a donkey,
    someone riding a camel,
Then let him pay heed,
    very close heed.

    8: 
    Then the watchman cried,
“On the watchtower, my Lord,
    I stand constantly by day;
And I stay at my post
    through all the watches of the night.

    9: Here he comes—
    a single chariot,
    a pair of horses—
He calls out and says,
    ‘Fallen, fallen is Babylon!
All the images of her gods
    are smashed to the ground!’”

    10: 
To you, who have been threshed,
    beaten on my threshing floor,
What I have heard
    from the Lord of hosts,
The God of Israel,
    I have announced to you.
Dumah

    11: 
    Oracle on Dumah:
They call to me from Seir,
    “Watchman, how much longer the night?
    Watchman, how much longer the night?”

    12: 
    The watchman replies,
“Morning has come, and again night.
    If you will ask, ask; come back again.”
In the Steppe

    13: 
    Oracle: in the steppe:
In the thicket in the steppe you will spend the night,
    caravans of Dedanites.

    14: 
Meet the thirsty, bring them water,
    inhabitants of the land of Tema,
    greet the fugitives with bread.

    15: 
For they have fled from the sword,
    from the drawn sword;
From the taut bow,
    from the thick of battle.

    16: For thus the Lord has said to me: In another year, like the years of a hired laborer, all the glory of Kedar shall come to an end. 
    17: Few of Kedar’s stalwart archers shall remain, for the Lord, the God of Israel, has spoken.


  Chapter 22.

    1: 
    2: 
The Valley of Vision
1 
    Oracle on the Valley of Vision:
What is the matter with you now, that you have gone up,
    all of you, to the housetops,
2 
[b]You who were full of noise,
    tumultuous city,
    exultant town?
Your slain are not slain with the sword,
    nor killed in battle.

    3: 
All your leaders fled away together,
    they were captured without use of bow;
All who were found were captured together,
    though they had fled afar off.

    4: 
That is why I say: Turn away from me,
    let me weep bitterly;
Do not try to comfort me
    for the ruin of the daughter of my people.

    5: 
It is a day of panic, rout and confusion,
    from the Lord, the God of hosts, in the Valley of Vision
Walls crash;
    a cry for help to the mountains.

    6: 
Elam takes up the quiver,
    Aram mounts the horses
    and Kir uncovers the shields.

    7: 
Your choice valleys are filled with chariots,
    horses are posted at the gates—

    8: 
    and shelter over Judah is removed.
On that day you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest; 
    9: f]you saw that the breaches in the City of David were many; you collected the water of the lower pool. 
    10: You numbered the houses of Jerusalem, tearing some down to strengthen the wall; 
    11: you made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you did not look to the city’s Maker, nor consider the one who fashioned it long ago.

    12: 
On that day the Lord,
    the God of hosts, called
For weeping and mourning,
    for shaving the head and wearing sackcloth.

    13: 
But look! instead, there was celebration and joy,
    slaughtering cattle and butchering sheep,
Eating meat and drinking wine:
    “Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”

    14: This message was revealed in my hearing from the Lord of hosts:
    This iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,
    says the Lord, the God of hosts.
Shebna and Eliakim

    15: 
Thus says the Lord, the God of hosts:
    Up, go to that official,
    Shebna, master of the palace,

    16: 
“What have you here? Whom have you here,
    that you have hewn for yourself a tomb here,
Hewing a tomb on high,
    carving a resting place in the rock?”

    17: 
The Lord shall hurl you down headlong, mortal man!
    He shall grip you firmly,

    18: 
And roll you up and toss you like a ball
    into a broad land.
There you will die, there with the chariots you glory in,
    you disgrace to your master’s house!

    19: 
I will thrust you from your office
    and pull you down from your station.

    20: 
On that day I will summon my servant
    Eliakim, son of Hilkiah;

    21: 
    22: The Valley of Vision
1 
    Oracle on the Valley of Vision:
What is the matter with you now, that you have gone up,
    all of you, to the housetops,
2 
[b]You who were full of noise,
    tumultuous city,
    exultant town?
Your slain are not slain with the sword,
    nor killed in battle.
3 
All your leaders fled away together,
    they were captured without use of bow;
All who were found were captured together,
    though they had fled afar off.
4 
That is why I say: Turn away from me,
    let me weep bitterly;
Do not try to comfort me
    for the ruin of the daughter of my people.
5 
It is a day of panic, rout and confusion,
    from the Lord, the God of hosts, in the Valley of Vision[c]
Walls crash;
    a cry for help to the mountains.
6 
Elam takes up the quiver,
    Aram mounts the horses
    and Kir[d] uncovers the shields.
7 
Your choice valleys are filled with chariots,
    horses are posted at the gates—
8 
    and shelter over Judah is removed.[e]
On that day you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest; 9 [f]you saw that the breaches in the City of David were many; you collected the water of the lower pool. 10 You numbered the houses of Jerusalem, tearing some down to strengthen the wall; 11 you made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you did not look to the city’s Maker, nor consider the one who fashioned it long ago.
12 
On that day the Lord,
    the God of hosts, called
For weeping and mourning,
    for shaving the head and wearing sackcloth.
13 
But look! instead, there was celebration and joy,
    slaughtering cattle and butchering sheep,
Eating meat and drinking wine:
    “Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”
14 This message was revealed in my hearing from the Lord of hosts:
    This iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,
    says the Lord, the God of hosts.
Shebna and Eliakim
15 
Thus says the Lord, the God of hosts:
    Up, go to that official,
    Shebna,[g] master of the palace,
16 
[h]“What have you here? Whom have you here,
    that you have hewn for yourself a tomb here,
Hewing a tomb on high,
    carving a resting place in the rock?”
17 
The Lord shall hurl you down headlong, mortal man!
    He shall grip you firmly,
18 
And roll you up and toss you like a ball
    into a broad land.
There you will die, there with the chariots you glory in,
    you disgrace to your master’s house!
19 
I will thrust you from your office
    and pull you down from your station.
20 
On that day I will summon my servant
    Eliakim,[i] son of Hilkiah;
21 
I will clothe him with your robe,
    gird him with your sash,
    confer on him your authority.
He shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
    and to the house of Judah.
22 
I will place the key[j] of the House of David on his shoulder;
    what he opens, no one will shut,
    what he shuts, no one will open.

    23: 
I will fix him as a peg in a firm place,
    a seat of honor for his ancestral house;

    24: 
On him shall hang all the glory of his ancestral house:
    descendants and offspring,
    all the little dishes, from bowls to jugs.

    25: On that day, says the Lord of hosts, the peg fixed in a firm place shall give way, break off and fall, and the weight that hung on it shall be done away with; for the Lord has spoken.


  Chapter 23.

    1: 
    2: 
    3: Tyre and Sidon
1 
    Oracle on Tyre:
Wail, ships of Tarshish,
    for your port is destroyed;
From the land of the Kittim[b]
    the news reaches them.
2 
Silence! you who dwell on the coast,
    you merchants of Sidon,
Whose messengers crossed the sea
3 
    over the deep waters,
Whose revenue was the grain of Shihor,[c] the harvest of the Nile,
    you who were the merchant among the nations.

    4: 
Be ashamed, Sidon, fortress on the sea,
    for the sea has spoken,
“I have not been in labor, nor given birth,
    nor raised young men,
    nor reared young women.”

    5: 
When the report reaches Egypt
    they shall be in anguish at the report about Tyre.

    6: 
Pass over to Tarshish,
    wail, you who dwell on the coast!

    7: 
Is this your exultant city,
    whose origin is from old,
Whose feet have taken her
    to dwell in distant lands?

    8: 
Who has planned such a thing
    against Tyre, the bestower of crowns,
Whose merchants are princes,
    whose traders are the earth’s honored men?

    9: The Lord of hosts has planned it,
    to disgrace the height of all beauty,
    to degrade all the honored of the earth.

    10: 
Cross to your own land,
    ship of Tarshish;
    the harbor is no more.

    11: 
His hand he stretches out over the sea,
    he shakes kingdoms;
The Lord commanded the destruction
    of Canaan’s strongholds:

    12: 
Crushed, you shall exult no more,
    virgin daughter Sidon.
Arise, pass over to the Kittim,
    even there you shall find no rest.

    13: 
Look at the land of the Chaldeans,
    the people that has ceased to be.
Assyria founded it for ships,
    raised its towers,
Only to tear down its palaces,
    and turn it into a ruin.

    14: 
Lament, ships of Tarshish,
    for your stronghold is destroyed.

    15: On that day, Tyre shall be forgotten for seventy years, the lifetime of one king. At the end of seventy years, the song about the prostitute will be Tyre’s song:

    16: 
Take a harp, go about the city,
    forgotten prostitute;
Pluck the strings skillfully, sing many songs,
    that you may be remembered.

    17: At the end of the seventy years the Lord shall visit Tyre. She shall return to her hire and serve as prostitute with all the world’s kingdoms on the face of the earth. 
    18: But her merchandise and her hire shall be sacred to the Lord. It shall not be stored up or laid away; instead, her merchandise shall belong to those who dwell before the Lord, to eat their fill and clothe themselves in choice attire.


  Chapter 24.

    1: 
    2: 
Judgment upon the World and the Lord’s Enthronement on Mount Zion
1 
See! The Lord is about to empty the earth and lay it waste;
    he will twist its surface,
    and scatter its inhabitants:
2 
People and priest shall fare alike:
    servant and master,
Maid and mistress,
    buyer and seller,
Lender and borrower,
    creditor and debtor.

    3: 
    4: Judgment upon the World and the Lord’s Enthronement on Mount Zion
1 
See! The Lord is about to empty the earth and lay it waste;
    he will twist its surface,
    and scatter its inhabitants:
2 
People and priest shall fare alike:
    servant and master,
Maid and mistress,
    buyer and seller,
Lender and borrower,
    creditor and debtor.
3 
The earth shall be utterly laid waste, utterly stripped,
    for the Lord has decreed this word.
4 
The earth mourns and fades,
    the world languishes and fades;
    both heaven and earth languish.

    5: 
The earth is polluted because of its inhabitants,
    for they have transgressed laws, violated statutes,
    broken the ancient covenant.

    6: 
Therefore a curse devours the earth,
    and its inhabitants pay for their guilt;
Therefore they who dwell on earth have dwindled,
    and only a few are left.

    7: 
The new wine mourns, the vine languishes,
    all the merry-hearted groan.

    8: 
Stilled are the cheerful timbrels,
    ended the shouts of the jubilant,
    stilled the cheerful harp.

    9: They no longer drink wine and sing;
    strong brew is bitter to those who drink it.

    10: 
Broken down is the city of chaos,
    every house is shut against entry.

    11: 
In the streets they cry out for lack of wine;
    all joy has grown dim,
    cheer is exiled from the land.

    12: 
In the city nothing remains but desolation,
    gates battered into ruins.

    13: 
For thus it shall be in the midst of the earth,
    among the peoples,
As when an olive tree has been beaten,
    as with a gleaning when the vintage is done.

    14: 
These shall lift up their voice,
    they shall sing for joy in the majesty of the Lord,
    they shall shout from the western sea:

    15: 
“Therefore, in the east
    give glory to the Lord!
In the coastlands of the sea,
    to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel!”

    16: 
From the end of the earth we hear songs:
    “Splendor to the Just One!”
But I said, “I am wasted, wasted away.
    Woe is me! The traitors betray;
    with treachery have the traitors betrayed!

    17: 
Terror, pit, and trap
    for you, inhabitant of the earth!

    18: 
One who flees at the sound of terror
    will fall into the pit;
One who climbs out of the pit
    will be caught in the trap.
For the windows on high are open
    and the foundations of the earth shake.

    19: 
The earth will burst asunder,
    the earth will be shaken apart,
    the earth will be convulsed.

    20: 
The earth will reel like a drunkard,
    sway like a hut;
Its rebellion will weigh it down;
    it will fall, never to rise again.”

    21: 
On that day the Lord will punish
    the host of the heavens in the heavens,
    and the kings of the earth on the earth.

    22: 
They will be gathered together
    like prisoners into a pit;
They will be shut up in a dungeon,
    and after many days they will be punished.

    23: 
    24: Judgment upon the World and the Lord’s Enthronement on Mount Zion
1 
See! The Lord is about to empty the earth and lay it waste;
    he will twist its surface,
    and scatter its inhabitants:
2

    servant and master,
Maid and mistress,
    buyer and seller,
Lender and borrower,
    creditor and debtor.
3 
The earth shall be utterly laid waste, utterly stripped,
    for the Lord has decreed this word.
4 
The earth mourns and fades,
    the world languishes and fades;
    both heaven and earth languish.
5 
The earth is polluted because of its inhabitants,
    for they have transgressed laws, violated statutes,
    broken the ancient covenant.[c]
6 
Therefore a curse devours the earth,
    and its inhabitants pay for their guilt;
Therefore they who dwell on earth have dwindled,
    and only a few are left.
7 
The new wine mourns, the vine languishes,
    all the merry-hearted groan.
8 
Stilled are the cheerful timbrels,
    ended the shouts of the jubilant,
    stilled the cheerful harp.
9 
They no longer drink wine and sing;
    strong brew is bitter to those who drink it.
10 
Broken down is the city of chaos,[d]
    every house is shut against entry.
11 
In the streets they cry out for lack of wine;
    all joy has grown dim,
    cheer is exiled from the land.
12 
In the city nothing remains but desolation,
    gates battered into ruins.
13 
For thus it shall be in the midst of the earth,
    among the peoples,
As when an olive tree has been beaten,
    as with a gleaning when the vintage is done.
14 
These[e] shall lift up their voice,
    they shall sing for joy in the majesty of the Lord,
    they shall shout from the western sea:
15 
“Therefore, in the east
    give glory to the Lord!
In the coastlands of the sea,
    to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel!”
16 
From the end of the earth we hear songs:
    “Splendor to the Just One!”
But I said, “I am wasted, wasted away.
    Woe is me! The traitors betray;
    with treachery have the traitors betrayed!
17 
Terror, pit, and trap
    for you, inhabitant of the earth!
18 
One who flees at the sound of terror
    will fall into the pit;
One who climbs out of the pit
    will be caught in the trap.
For the windows on high are open
    and the foundations of the earth shake.
19 
The earth will burst asunder,
    the earth will be shaken apart,
    the earth will be convulsed.
20 
The earth will reel like a drunkard,
    sway like a hut;
Its rebellion will weigh it down;
    it will fall, never to rise again.”
21 
On that day the Lord will punish
    the host of the heavens[f] in the heavens,
    and the kings of the earth on the earth.
22 
They will be gathered together
    like prisoners into a pit;
They will be shut up in a dungeon,
    and after many days they will be punished.
23 
Then the moon will blush
    and the sun be ashamed,
For the Lord of hosts will reign
    on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,
    glorious in the sight of the elders.[g]


End of day 217.
