    2: 
    3: a]
Prayer for Help
1 For the leader. A psalm of David.
I
2 
How long, Lord? Will you utterly forget me?
    How long will you hide your face from me?
3 
How long must I carry sorrow in my soul,
    grief in my heart day after day?
    How long will my enemy triumph over me?
II

    4: 
Look upon me, answer me, Lord, my God!
    Give light to my eyes lest I sleep in death,

    5: 
Lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed,”
    lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.
III

    6: 
But I trust in your mercy.
    Grant my heart joy in your salvation,
I will sing to the Lord,
    for he has dealt bountifully with me!


  Chapter 14.

    1: 
A Lament over Widespread Corruption
1 For the leader. Of David.
I
The fool says in his heart,
    “There is no God.”
Their deeds are loathsome and corrupt;
    not one does what is good.

    2: 
The Lord looks down from heaven
    upon the children of men,
To see if even one is wise,
    if even one seeks God.

    3: 
    4: a]

    not one does what is good.
2 
The Lord looks down from heaven
    upon the children of men,
To see if even one is wise,
    if even one seeks God.
3 
All have gone astray;
    all alike are perverse.
Not one does what is good,
    not even one.
II
4 
Will these evildoers never learn?
    They devour my people as they devour bread;
    they do not call upon the Lord.

    5: 
They have good reason, then, to fear;
    God is with the company of the just.

    6: 
They would crush the hopes of the poor,
    but the poor have the Lord as their refuge.
III

    7: 
Oh, that from Zion might come
    the salvation of Israel!
Jacob would rejoice, and Israel be glad
    when the Lord restores his people!


  Chapter 15.

    1: 
The Righteous Israelite
1 A psalm of David.
I
Lord, who may abide in your tent?[b]
    Who may dwell on your holy mountain?
II

    2: 
Whoever walks without blame,
    doing what is right,
    speaking truth from the heart;

    3: 
Who does not slander with his tongue,
    does no harm to a friend,
    never defames a neighbor;

2 
Whoever walks without blame,
    doing what is right,
    speaking truth from the heart;
3 
Who does not slander with his tongue,
    does no harm to a friend,
    never defames a neighbor;
4 
Who disdains the wicked,
    but honors those who fear the Lord;
    Who keeps an oath despite the cost,
5 
    lends no money at interest,[c]
    accepts no bribe against the innocent.
III
Whoever acts like this
    shall never be shaken.

God the Supreme Good

Keep me safe, O God;
    in you I take refuge.

I say to the Lord,
    you are my Lord,
    you are my only good.

    3: 
As for the holy ones who are in the land,
    they are noble,
    in whom is all my delight.

    4: 
They multiply their sorrows
    who court other gods.
Blood libations to them I will not pour out,
    nor will I take their names upon my lips.

    you have made my destiny secure.
6 
[d]Pleasant places were measured out for me;
    fair to me indeed is my inheritance.
II

    7: 
I bless the Lord who counsels me;
    even at night my heart exhorts me.

    8: 
I keep the Lord always before me;
    with him at my right hand, I shall never be shaken.

    9: Therefore my heart is glad, my soul rejoices;
    my body also dwells secure,

    10: 
For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol,
    nor let your devout one see the pit.

    11: 
You will show me the path to life,
    abounding joy in your presence,
    the delights at your right hand forever.
