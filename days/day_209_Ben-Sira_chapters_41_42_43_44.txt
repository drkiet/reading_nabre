Day 209:

Reading Ben-Sira, chapters ['41', '42', '43', '44']:

  Chapter 41.

    1: 1 
O death! How bitter is the thought of you
    for the one at peace in his home,
For the one who is serene and always successful,
    who can still enjoy life’s pleasures.

    2: 
O death! How welcome is your sentence
    to the weak, failing in strength,
Stumbling and tripping on everything,
    with sight gone and hope lost.

    3: 
    4: 
1 
O death! How bitter is the thought of you
    for the one at peace in his home,
For the one who is serene and always successful,
    who can still enjoy life’s pleasures.
2 
O death! How welcome is your sentence
    to the weak, failing in strength,
Stumbling and tripping on everything,
    with sight gone and hope lost.
3 
Do not fear death’s decree for you;
    remember, it embraces those before you and those to come.
4 
This decree for all flesh is from God;
    why then should you reject a law of the Most High?
Whether one has lived a thousand years, a hundred, or ten,
    in Sheol there are no arguments about life.

    5: 
The children of sinners are a reprobate line,
    and witless offspring are in the homes of the wicked.

    6: 
The inheritance of children of sinners will perish,
    and on their offspring will be perpetual disgrace.

    7: 
Children curse their wicked father,
    for they suffer disgrace because of him.

    8: 
Woe to you, O wicked people,
    who forsake the Law of the Most High.

    9: If you have children, calamity will be theirs;
    and if you beget them, it will be only for groaning.
When you stumble, there is lasting joy;
    and when you die, you become a curse.

    10: 
All that is nought returns to nought,
    so too the godless—from void to void.

    11: 
The human body is a fleeting thing,
    but a virtuous name will never be annihilated.

    12: 
Have respect for your name, for it will stand by you
    more than thousands of precious treasures.

    13: 
The good things of life last a number of days,
    but a good name, for days without number.
True and False Shame

    14:  
Hidden wisdom and concealed treasure,
    of what value is either?

    15: 
Better is the person who hides his folly
    than the one who hides his wisdom.
14a 
My children, listen to instruction about shame;

    16:  
    judge of disgrace according to my rules,
16b 
Not every kind of shame is shameful,
    nor is every kind of disgrace to be recognized.

    17: 
Before father and mother be ashamed of immorality,
    before prince and ruler, of falsehood;

    18: 
Before master and mistress, of deceit;
    before the public assembly, of crime;
Before associate and friend, of disloyalty,

    19: 
    and in the place where you settle, of theft.
Be ashamed of breaking an oath or a covenant,
    and of stretching your elbow at dinner;
Of refusing to give when asked,
21 
    of rebuffing your own relatives;
Of defrauding another of his appointed share,

    20: 
    21: 
    of rebuffing your own relatives;
Of defrauding another of his appointed share,
20a 
    of failing to return a greeting;
21c 
Of gazing at a man’s wife,
20b 
    of entertaining thoughts about another woman;

    22: 
Of trifling with a servant girl you have,
    of violating her bed;
Of using harsh words with friends,
    of following up your gifts with insults;


  Chapter 42.

    1: 
    2: 1 
Of repeating what you hear,
    of betraying any secret.
Be ashamed of the right things,
    and you will find favor in the sight of all.
But of these things do not be ashamed,
    lest you sin to save face:
2 
Of the Law of the Most High and his precepts,
    or of justice that acquits the ungodly;

    3: 
    4: 
1 
Of repeating what you hear,
    of betraying any secret.
Be ashamed of the right things,
    and you will find favor in the sight of all.
But of these things do not be ashamed,
    lest you sin to save face:
2 
Of the Law of the Most High and his precepts,
    or of justice that acquits the ungodly;
3 
Of sharing the expenses of a business or a journey,
    of dividing an inheritance or property;
4 
Of accuracy of scales and balances,
    of tested measures and weights;
Of acquiring much or little,

    5: 
    of bargaining in dealing with a merchant;
Of constant training of children,
    of beating the sides of a wicked servant;

    6: 
Of a seal to keep a foolish wife at home,
    of a key where there are many hands;

    7: 
Of numbering every deposit,
    of recording all that is taken in and given out;

    8: 
Of chastisement for the silly and the foolish,
    for the aged and infirm answering for wanton conduct.
Thus you will be truly refined
    and recognized by all as discreet.
A Father’s Care for His Daughter

    9: A daughter is a treasure that keeps her father wakeful,
    and worry over her drives away sleep:
Lest in her youth she remain unmarried,
    or when she is married, lest she be childless;

    10: 
While unmarried, lest she be defiled,
    or in her husband’s house, lest she prove unfaithful;
Lest she become pregnant in her father’s house,
    or be sterile in that of her husband.

    11: 
My son, keep a close watch on your daughter,
    lest she make you a laughingstock for your enemies,
A byword in the city and the assembly of the people,
    an object of derision in public gatherings.
See that there is no lattice in her room,
    or spot that overlooks the approaches to the house.

    12: 
Do not let her reveal her beauty to any male,
    or spend her time with married women;

    13: 
For just as moths come from garments,
    so a woman’s wickedness comes from a woman.

    14: 
Better a man’s harshness than a woman’s indulgence,
    a frightened daughter than any disgrace.
The Works of God in Nature

    15: 
Now will I recall God’s works;
    what I have seen, I will describe.
By the Lord’s word his works were brought into being;
    he accepts the one who does his will.

    16: 
As the shining sun is clear to all,
    so the glory of the Lord fills all his works;

    17: 
Yet even God’s holy ones must fail
    in recounting the wonders of the Lord,
Though God has given his hosts the strength
    to stand firm before his glory.

    18: 
He searches out the abyss and penetrates the heart;
    their secrets he understands.
For the Most High possesses all knowledge,
    and sees from of old the things that are to come.

    19: 
He makes known the past and the future,
    and reveals the deepest secrets.

    20: 
He lacks no understanding;
    no single thing escapes him.

    21: 
He regulates the mighty deeds of his wisdom;
    he is from all eternity one and the same,
With nothing added, nothing taken away;
    no need of a counselor for him!

    22: 
How beautiful are all his works,
    delightful to gaze upon and a joy to behold!

    23: 
Everything lives and abides forever;
    and to meet each need all things are preserved.

    24: 
All of them differ, one from another,
    yet none of them has he made in vain;

    25: 
For each in turn, as it comes, is good;
    can one ever see enough of their splendor?


  Chapter 43.

    1: 
The beauty of the celestial height and the pure firmament,
    heaven itself manifests its glory.

    2: 
    3: 
    4: 
1 
The beauty of the celestial height and the pure firmament,
    heaven itself manifests its glory.
2 
The sun at its rising shines at its fullest,
    a wonderful instrument, the work of the Most High!
3 
At noon it scorches the earth,
    and who can bear its fiery heat?
4 
Like a blazing furnace of solid metal,
    the sun’s rays set the mountains aflame;
Its fiery tongue consumes the world;
    the eyes are burned by its fire.

    5: 
Great indeed is the Lord who made it,
    at whose orders it urges on its steeds.

    6: 
It is the moon that marks the changing seasons,
    governing the times, their lasting sign.

    7: 
By it we know the sacred seasons and pilgrimage feasts,
    a light which wanes in its course:

    8: 
The new moon like its name renews itself;
    how wondrous it is when it changes:
A military signal for the waterskins on high,
    it paves the firmament with its brilliance,

    9: The beauty of the heavens and the glory of the stars,
    a shining ornament in the heights of God.

    10: 
By the Lord’s command the moon keeps its appointed place,
    and does not fade as the stars keep watch.

    11: 
Behold the rainbow! Then bless its Maker,
    for majestic indeed is its splendor;

    12: 
It spans the heavens with its glory,
    the hand of God has stretched it out in power.

    13: 
His rebuke marks out the path for the hail,
    and makes the flashes of his judgment shine forth.

    14: 
For his own purposes he opens the storehouse
    and makes the rain clouds fly like vultures.

    15: 
His might gives the clouds their strength,
    and breaks off the hailstones.

    16: 
The thunder of his voice makes the earth writhe;
    by his power he shakes the mountains.

    17: 
A word from him drives on the south wind,
    whirlwind, hurricane, and stormwind.
He makes the snow fly like birds;
    it settles down like swarms of locusts.

    18: 
Its shining whiteness blinds the eyes,
    the mind marvels at its steady fall.

    19: 
He scatters frost like salt;
    it shines like blossoms on the thornbush.

    20: 
He sends cold northern blasts
    that harden the ponds like solid ground,
Spreads a crust over every body of water,
    and clothes each pool with a coat of armor.

    21: 
When mountain growth is scorched by heat,
    and flowering plains as by fire,

    22: 
The dripping clouds restore them all,
    and the scattered dew enriches the parched land.

    23: 
His is the plan that calms the deep,
    and plants the islands in the sea.

    24: 
Those who go down to the sea recount its extent,
    and when we hear them we are thunderstruck;

    25: 
In it are his creatures, stupendous, amazing,
    all kinds of life, and the monsters of the deep.

    26: 
For him each messenger succeeds,
    and at his bidding accomplishes his will.

    27: 
More than this we need not add;
    let the last word be, he is the all!

    28: 
Let us praise him the more, since we cannot fathom him,
    for greater is he than all his works;

    29: 
Awesome indeed is the Lord,
    and wonderful his power.

    30: 
Lift up your voices to glorify the Lord
    as much as you can, for there is still more.
Extol him with renewed strength,
    do not grow weary, for you cannot fathom him.

    31: 
For who has seen him and can describe him?
    Who can praise him as he is?

    32: 
Beyond these, many things lie hidden;
    only a few of his works have I seen.

    33: 
It is the Lord who has made all things;
    to those who fear him he gives wisdom.


  Chapter 44.

    1: 
I will now praise the godly,
    our ancestors, in their own time,

    2: 
The abounding glory of the Most High’s portion,
    his own part, since the days of old.

    3: 
    4: 
Praise of Israel’s Great Ancestors
1 
I will now praise the godly,
    our ancestors, in their own time,[b]
2 
The abounding glory of the Most High’s portion,
    his own part, since the days of old.
3 
Subduers of the land in kingly fashion,
    renowned for their might,
Counselors in their prudence,
    seers of all things in prophecy,
4 
Resolute princes of the flock,
    lawgivers and their rules,
Sages skilled in composition,
    authors of sharp proverbs,

    5: 
Composers of melodious psalms,
    writers of lyric poems;

    6: 
Stalwart, solidly established,
    at peace in their own estates—

    7: 
All these were glorious in their time,
    illustrious in their day.

    8: 
Some of them left behind a name
    so that people recount their praises.

    9: Of others no memory remains,
    for when they perished, they perished,
As if they had never lived,
    they and their children after them.

    10: 
Yet these also were godly;
    their virtues have not been forgotten.

    11: 
Their wealth remains in their families,
    their heritage with their descendants.

    12: 
Through God’s covenant their family endures,
    and their offspring for their sake.

    13: 
And for all time their progeny will endure,
    their glory will never be blotted out;

    14: 
Their bodies are buried in peace,
    but their name lives on and on.

    15: 
At gatherings their wisdom is retold,
    and the assembly proclaims their praises.
The Early Ancestors

    16: 
 walked with the Lord and was taken,
    that succeeding generations might learn by his example.]

    17: 
Noah, found just and perfect,
    renewed the race in the time of devastation.
Because of his worth there were survivors,
    and with a sign to him the deluge ended.

    18: 
A lasting covenant was made with him,
    that never again would all flesh be destroyed.

    19: 
Abraham, father of many peoples,
    kept his glory without stain:

    20: 
He observed the Most High’s command,
    and entered into a covenant with him;
In his own flesh he incised the ordinance,
    and when tested was found loyal.

    21: 
For this reason, God promised him with an oath
    to bless the nations through his descendants,
To make him numerous as grains of dust,
    and to exalt his posterity like the stars,
Giving them an inheritance from sea to sea,
    and from the River to the ends of the earth.

    22: 
For Isaac, too, he renewed the same promise
    because of Abraham, his father.
The covenant with all his forebears was confirmed,

    23: 
    and the blessing rested upon the head of Israel.
God acknowledged him as the firstborn,
    and gave him his inheritance.
He fixed the boundaries for his tribes
    and their division into twelve.
