  Chapter 129.

    1: 
    2: 
Against Israel’s Enemies
1 A song of ascents.
I
Viciously have they attacked me from my youth,
    let Israel say now.
2 
Viciously have they attacked me from my youth,
    yet they have not prevailed against me.

    3: 
Upon my back the plowers plowed,
    as they traced their long furrows.

    4: 
But the just Lord cut me free
    from the ropes of the wicked.
II

    5: 
May they recoil in disgrace,
    all who hate Zion.

    6: 
May they be like grass on the rooftops
    withered in early growth,

    7: 
Never to fill the reaper’s hands,
    nor the arms of the binders of sheaves,

    8:

5 
May they recoil in disgrace,
    all who hate Zion.
6 
May they be like grass on the rooftops[c]
    withered in early growth,
7 
Never to fill the reaper’s hands,
    nor the arms of the binders of sheaves,
8 
And with none passing by to call out:
    “The blessing of the Lord be upon you![d]
    We bless you in the name of the Lord!”

    2: 
    3: 
Prayer for Pardon and Mercy
1 A song of ascents.
I
Out of the depths[b] I call to you, Lord;
2 
    Lord, hear my cry!
May your ears be attentive
    to my cry for mercy.
3 
If you, Lord, keep account of sins,
    Lord, who can stand?

    4: 
But with you is forgiveness
    and so you are revered.
II

    5: 
I wait for the Lord,
    my soul waits
    and I hope for his word.

    6: 
My soul looks for the Lord
    more than sentinels for daybreak.
More than sentinels for daybreak,

    7: 
    let Israel hope in the Lord,
For with the Lord is mercy,
    with him is plenteous redemption,

    8: 
And he will redeem Israel
    from all its sins.


  Chapter 131.

    1: 1
Humble Trust in God
1 A song of ascents. Of David.
Lord, my heart is not proud;
    nor are my eyes haughty.
I do not busy myself with great matters,
    with things too sublime for me.

    2: 
    3: 
Humble Trust in God
1 A song of ascents. Of David.
Lord, my heart is not proud;
    nor are my eyes haughty.
I do not busy myself with great matters,
    with things too sublime for me.
2 
Rather, I have stilled my soul,
Like a weaned child to its mother,
    weaned is my soul.
3 
Israel, hope in the Lord,
    now and forever.


  Chapter 132.

    1: 
    2: 
    3: 
The Covenant Between David and God
1 A song of ascents.
I
Remember, O Lord, for David
    all his hardships;
2 
How he swore an oath to the Lord,
    vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:[b]
3 
“I will not enter the house where I live,
    nor lie on the couch where I sleep;

    4: 
I will give my eyes no sleep,
    my eyelids no rest,

    5: 
Till I find a place for the Lord,
    a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”

    6: 
“We have heard of it in Ephrathah;
    we have found it in the fields of Jaar.

    7: 
Let us enter his dwelling;
    let us worship at his footstool.”

    8: 
“Arise, Lord, come to your resting place,
    you and your mighty ark.

    9: Your priests will be clothed with justice;
    your devout will shout for joy.”

    10: 
For the sake of David your servant,
    do not reject your anointed.
II

    11: 
The Lord swore an oath to David in truth,
    he will never turn back from it:
“Your own offspring I will set upon your throne.

    12: 
    13: 
The Covenant Between David and God
1 A song of ascents.
I
Remember, O Lord, for David
    all his hardships;
2 
How he swore an oath to the Lord,
    vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:[b]
3 
“I will not enter the house where I live,
    nor lie on the couch where I sleep;
4 
I will give my eyes no sleep,
    my eyelids no rest,
5 
Till I find a place for the Lord,
    a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
6 
“We have heard of it in Ephrathah;[c]
    we have found it in the fields of Jaar.
7 
Let us enter his dwelling;
    let us worship at his footstool.”
8 
“Arise, Lord, come to your resting place,
    you and your mighty ark.
9 
Your priests will be clothed with justice;
    your devout will shout for joy.”
10 
For the sake of David your servant,
    do not reject your anointed.
II
11 
The Lord swore an oath to David in truth,
    he will never turn back from it:
“Your own offspring I will set upon your throne.
12 
If your sons observe my covenant,
    and my decrees I shall teach them,
Their sons, in turn,
    shall sit forever on your throne.”
13 
Yes, the Lord has chosen Zion,
    desired it for a dwelling:

    14: 
“This is my resting place forever;
    here I will dwell, for I desire it.

    15: 
I will bless Zion with provisions;
    its poor I will fill with bread.

    16: 
I will clothe its priests with salvation;
    its devout shall shout for joy.

    17: 
There I will make a horn sprout for David;
    I will set a lamp for my anointed.

    18: 
His foes I will clothe with shame,
    but on him his crown shall shine.”
