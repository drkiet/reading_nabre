Day 202:

Reading Ben-Sira, chapters ['13', '14', '15', '16']:

  Chapter 13.

    1: 
Caution Regarding Associates
1 
Touch pitch and you blacken your hand;
    associate with scoundrels and you learn their ways.

    2: 
    3: Caution Regarding Associates
1 
Touch pitch and you blacken your hand;
    associate with scoundrels and you learn their ways.
2 
Do not lift a weight too heavy for you,
    or associate with anyone wealthier than you.
How can the clay pot go with the metal cauldron?
    When they knock together, the pot will be smashed:
3 
The rich do wrong and boast of it,
    while the poor are wronged and beg forgiveness.

    4: 
As long as the rich can use you they will enslave you,
    but when you are down and out they will abandon you.

    5: 
As long as you have anything they will live with you,
    but they will drain you dry without remorse.

    6: 
When they need you they will deceive you
    and smile at you and raise your hopes;
    they will speak kindly to you and say, “What do you need?”

    7: 
They will embarrass you at their dinner parties,
    and finally laugh at you.
Afterwards, when they see you, they will pass you by,
    and shake their heads at you.

    8: 
Be on guard: do not act too boldly;
    do not be like those who lack sense.

    9: When the influential draw near, keep your distance;
    then they will urge you all the more.

    10: 
Do not draw too close, lest you be rebuffed,
    but do not keep too far away lest you be regarded as an enemy.

    11: 
Do not venture to be free with them,
    do not trust their many words;
For by prolonged talk they will test you,
    and though smiling they will probe you.

    12: 
    13: Caution Regarding Associates

Touch pitch and you blacken your hand;
    associate with scoundrels and you learn their ways.

11

    do not trust their many words;
For by prolonged talk they will test you,
    and though smiling they will probe you.
12 
Mercilessly they will make you a laughingstock,
    and will not refrain from injury or chains.
13 
Be on your guard and take care
    never to accompany lawless people.[b]
15 
Every living thing loves its own kind,
    and we all love someone like ourselves.
16 
Every living being keeps close to its own kind;
    and people associate with their own kind.
17 
Is a wolf ever allied with a lamb?
    So the sinner with the righteous.
18 
Can there be peace between the hyena and the dog?
    Or peace between the rich and the poor?[c]
19 
Wild donkeys of the desert are lion’s prey;
    likewise the poor are feeding grounds for the rich.
20 
Humility is an abomination to the proud;
    and the poor are an abomination to the rich.
21 
When the rich stumble they are supported by friends;
    when the poor trip they are pushed down by friends.
22 
When the rich speak they have many supporters;
    though what they say is repugnant, it wins approval.
When the poor speak people say, “Come, come, speak up!”
    though they are talking sense, they get no hearing.
23 
When the rich speak all are silent,
    their wisdom people extol to the clouds.
When the poor speak people say: “Who is that?”
    If they stumble, people knock them down.
24 
Wealth is good where there is no sin;[d]
    but poverty is evil by the standards of the proud.
25 
The heart changes one’s face,
    either for good or for evil.
26 
The sign of a good heart is a radiant face;
    withdrawn and perplexed is the toiling schemer.


  Chapter 14.

    1: 
1 
Happy those whose mouth causes them no grief,
    those who are not stung by remorse for sin.

    2: 
Happy are those whose conscience does not reproach them,
    those who have not lost hope.
The Use of Wealth

    3: 
    4: 1 
Happy those whose mouth causes them no grief,
    those who are not stung by remorse for sin.
2 
Happy are those whose conscience does not reproach them,
    those who have not lost hope.
The Use of Wealth
3 
Wealth is not appropriate for the mean-spirited;[b]
    to misers, what use is gold?
4 
What they deny themselves they collect for someone else,
    and strangers will live sumptuously on their possessions.

    5: 
To whom will they be generous that are stingy with themselves
    and do not enjoy what is their own?

    6: 
None are worse than those who are stingy with themselves;
    they punish their own avarice.

    7: 
If ever they do good, it is by mistake;
    in the end they reveal their meanness.

    8: 
Misers are evil people,
    they turn away and disregard others.

    9: The greedy see their share as not enough;
    greedy injustice dries up the soul.

    10: 
The eye of the miserly is rapacious for food,
    but there is none of it on their own table.

    11: 
My son, if you have the means, treat yourself well,
    and enjoy life as best you can.

    12: 
Remember that death does not delay,
    and you have not been told the grave’s appointed time.

    13: 
    14: 1 
Happy those whose mouth causes them no grief,
    those who are not stung by remorse for sin.
2 
Happy are those whose conscience does not reproach them,
    those who have not lost hope.

9

    greedy injustice dries up the soul.
10 
The eye of the miserly is rapacious for food,
    but there is none of it on their own table.
11 
[c]My son, if you have the means, treat yourself well,
    and enjoy life as best you can.
12 
Remember that death does not delay,
    and you have not been told the grave’s appointed time.
13 
Before you die, be good to your friends;
    give them a share in what you possess.
14 
Do not deprive yourself of good things now
    or let a choice portion escape you.

    15: 
Will you not leave your riches to others,
    and your earnings to be divided by lot?

    16: 
Give and take, treat yourself well,
    for in Sheol there are no joys to seek.

    17: 
All flesh grows old like a garment;
    the age-old law is: everyone must die.

    18: 
As with the leaves growing on a luxuriant tree—
    one falls off and another sprouts—
So with the generations of flesh and blood:
    one dies and another flourishes.

    19: 
All human deeds surely perish;
    the works they do follow after them.
The Search for Wisdom and Her Blessings

    20: 
Happy those who meditate on Wisdom,
    and fix their gaze on knowledge;

    21: 
Who ponder her ways in their heart,
    and understand her paths;

    22: 
Who pursue her like a scout,
    and watch at her entry way;

    23: 
Who peep through her windows,
    and listen at her doors;

    24: 
Who encamp near her house
    and fasten their tent pegs next to her walls;

    25: 
Who pitch their tent beside her,
    and dwell in a good place;

    26: 
Who build their nest in her leaves,
    and lodge in her branches;

    27: 
Who take refuge from the heat in her shade
    and dwell in her home.


  Chapter 15.

    1: 
1 
Whoever fears the Lord will do this;
    whoever is practiced in the Law will come to Wisdom.

    2: 
She will meet him like a mother;
    like a young bride she will receive him,

    3: 
She will feed him with the bread of learning,
    and give him the water of understanding to drink.

    4: 
    5: 1 
Whoever fears the Lord will do this;
    whoever is practiced in the Law will come to Wisdom.
2 
She will meet him like a mother;
    like a young bride she will receive him,
3 
She will feed him with the bread of learning,
    and give him the water of understanding to drink.
4 
He will lean upon her and not fall;
    he will trust in her and not be put to shame.
5 
She will exalt him above his neighbors,
    and in the assembly she will make him eloquent.

    6: 
Joy and gladness he will find,
    and an everlasting name he will inherit.

    7: 
The worthless will not attain her,
    and the haughty will not behold her.

    8: 
She is far from the impious;
    liars never think of her.

    9: Praise is unseemly on the lips of sinners,
    for it has not been allotted to them by God.

    10: 
But praise is uttered by the mouth of the wise,
    and its rightful owner teaches it.
Free Will

    11: 
Do not say: “It was God’s doing that I fell away,”
    for what he hates he does not do.

    12: 
Do not say: “He himself has led me astray,”
    for he has no need of the wicked.

    13: 
Abominable wickedness the Lord hates
    and he does not let it happen to those who fear him.

    14: 
    15: 1 
Whoever fears the Lord will do this;
    whoever is practiced in the Law will come to Wisdom.
2 
She will meet him like a mother;
    like a young bride she will receive him,
3 
She will feed him with the bread of learning,
    and give him the water of understanding to drink.
4 
He will lean upon her and not fall;
    he will trust in her and not be put to shame.
5 
She will exalt him above his neighbors,
    and in the assembly she will make him eloquent.
6 
Joy and gladness he will find,
    and an everlasting name he will inherit.
7 
The worthless will not attain her,
    and the haughty will not behold her.
8 
She is far from the impious;
    liars never think of her.
9 
[b]Praise is unseemly on the lips of sinners,
    for it has not been allotted to them by God.
10 
But praise is uttered by the mouth of the wise,
    and its rightful owner teaches it.
Free Will[c]
11 
Do not say: “It was God’s doing that I fell away,”
    for what he hates he does not do.
12 
Do not say: “He himself has led me astray,”
    for he has no need of the wicked.
13 
Abominable wickedness the Lord hates
    and he does not let it happen to those who fear him.
14 
God in the beginning created human beings
    and made them subject to their own free choice.
15 
If you choose, you can keep the commandments;
    loyalty is doing the will of God.

    16: 
Set before you are fire and water;
    to whatever you choose, stretch out your hand.

    17: 
Before everyone are life and death,
    whichever they choose will be given them.

    18: 
Immense is the wisdom of the Lord;
    mighty in power, he sees all things.

    19: 
The eyes of God behold his works,
    and he understands every human deed.

    20: 
He never commands anyone to sin,
    nor shows leniency toward deceivers.


  Chapter 16.

    1: 
God’s Punishment of Sinners
1 
Do not yearn for worthless children,
    or rejoice in wicked offspring.

    2: 
Even if they be many, do not rejoice in them
    if they do not have fear of the Lord.

    3: 
Do not count on long life for them,
    or have any hope for their future.
For one can be better than a thousand;
    rather die childless than have impious children!

    4: 
Through one wise person a city can be peopled;
    but through a clan of rebels it becomes desolate.

    5: 
    6: God’s Punishment of Sinners
1 
Do not yearn for worthless children,
    or rejoice in wicked offspring.
2 
Even if they be many, do not rejoice in them
    if they do not have fear of the Lord.
3 
Do not count on long life for them,
    or have any hope for their future.
For one can be better than a thousand;
    rather die childless than have impious children!
4 
Through one wise person a city can be peopled;
    but through a clan of rebels it becomes desolate.
5 
Many such things my eye has seen,
    and even more than these my ear has heard.
6 
Against a sinful band fire is kindled,
    upon a godless people wrath blazes.[b]

    7: 
He did not forgive the princes of old
    who rebelled long ago in their might.

    8: 
He did not spare the neighbors of Lot,
    abominable in their pride.

    9: He did not spare the doomed people,
    dispossessed because of their sin;

    10: 
Nor the six hundred thousand foot soldiers,
    sent to their graves for the arrogance of their hearts.

    11: 
Had there been but one stiff-necked person,
    it would be a wonder had he gone unpunished.
For mercy and anger alike are with him;
    he remits and forgives, but also pours out wrath.

    12: 
Great as his mercy is his punishment;
    he judges people, each according to their deeds.

    13: 
Criminals do not escape with their plunder;
    the hope of the righteous, God never leaves unfulfilled.

    14: 
Whoever does good has a reward;
    each receives according to their deeds.
17 
Do not say: “I am hidden from God;
    and on high who remembers me?
Among so many people I am unknown;
    what am I in the world of spirits?
18 
Look, the heavens and the highest heavens,
    the abyss and the earth tremble at his visitation.
19 
The roots of the mountains and the earth’s foundations—
    at his mere glance they quiver and quake.
20 
Of me, therefore, he will take no notice;
    with my ways who will be concerned?
21 
If I sin, no eye will see me;
    if all in secret I act deceitfully, who is to know?
22 
Who tells him about just deeds?
    What can I expect for doing my duty?”
23 
Such the thoughts of the senseless;
    only the foolish entertain them.
Divine Wisdom Seen in Creation[i]
24 
Listen to me, my son, and take my advice,
    and apply your mind to my words,
25 
While I pour out my spirit by measure
    and impart knowledge with care.
26 
When at the first God created his works
    and, as he made them, assigned their tasks,
27 
He arranged for all time what they were to do,
    their domains from generation to generation.
They were not to go hungry or grow weary,
    or ever cease from their tasks.
28 
Never does a single one crowd its neighbor,
    or do any ever disobey his word.
29 
Then the Lord looked upon the earth,
    and filled it with his blessings.
30 
Its surface he covered with every kind of living creature
    which must return into it again.
