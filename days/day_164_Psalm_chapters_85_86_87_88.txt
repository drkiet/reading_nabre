    2: 
Lord, the God of my salvation, I call out by day;
    at night I cry aloud in your presence.

    3: 
Let my prayer come before you;
    incline your ear to my cry.

    4: 
For my soul is filled with troubles;
    my life draws near to Sheol.

    5: 
I am reckoned with those who go down to the pit;
    I am like a warrior without strength.

    6: 
My couch is among the dead,
    like the slain who lie in the grave.
You remember them no more;
    they are cut off from your influence.

    7: 
    8: 
A Despairing Lament

6 
My couch is among the dead,
    like the slain who lie in the grave.
You remember them no more;
    they are cut off from your influence.
7 
You plunge me into the bottom of the pit,
    into the darkness of the abyss.
8 
Your wrath lies heavy upon me;
    all your waves crash over me.
Selah
II

    9: Because of you my acquaintances shun me;
    you make me loathsome to them;
Caged in, I cannot escape;

    10: 
    my eyes grow dim from trouble.
All day I call on you, Lord;
    I stretch out my hands to you.

    11: 
Do you work wonders for the dead?
    Do the shades arise and praise you?
Selah
III

    12: 
Is your mercy proclaimed in the grave,
    your faithfulness among those who have perished?

    13: 
Are your marvels declared in the darkness,
    your righteous deeds in the land of oblivion?
IV

    14: 
But I cry out to you, Lord;
    in the morning my prayer comes before you.

    15: 
Why do you reject my soul, Lord,
    and hide your face from me?

    16: 
I have been mortally afflicted since youth;
    I have borne your terrors and I am made numb.

    17: 
Your wrath has swept over me;
    your terrors have destroyed me.

    18: 
All day they surge round like a flood;
    from every side they encircle me.

    19: 
Because of you friend and neighbor shun me;
    my only friend is darkness.
