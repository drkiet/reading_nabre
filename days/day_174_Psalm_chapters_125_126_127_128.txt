Day 174:

Reading Psalm, chapters ['125', '126', '127', '128']:

  Chapter 125.

    1: 
    2: 
Israel’s Protector
1 A song of ascents.
Those trusting in the Lord are like Mount Zion,
    unshakable, forever enduring.
2 
As mountains surround Jerusalem,
    the Lord surrounds his people
    both now and forever.

    3: 
The scepter of the wicked will not prevail
    in the land allotted to the just,
Lest the just themselves
    turn their hands to evil.

    4: 
    5: a]
Israel’s Protector
1 A song of ascents.
Those trusting in the Lord are like Mount Zion,
    unshakable, forever enduring.
2 
As mountains surround Jerusalem,
    the Lord surrounds his people
    both now and forever.
3 
The scepter of the wicked will not prevail
    in the land allotted to the just,[b]
Lest the just themselves
    turn their hands to evil.
4 
Do good, Lord, to the good,
    to those who are upright of heart.
5 
But those who turn aside to crooked ways
    may the Lord send down with the evildoers.
Peace upon Israel!


  Chapter 126.

    1: 
    2: 
The Reversal of Zion’s Fortunes
1 A song of ascents.
I
When the Lord restored the captives of Zion,
    we thought we were dreaming.
2 
Then our mouths were filled with laughter;
    our tongues sang for joy.
Then it was said among the nations,
    “The Lord had done great things for them.”

    3: 
The Lord has done great things for us;
    Oh, how happy we were!

    4: 
Restore our captives, Lord,
    like the dry stream beds of the Negeb.
II

    5: 
    6: a]
The Reversal of Zion’s Fortunes
1 A song of ascents.
I
When the Lord restored the captives of Zion,
    we thought we were dreaming.
2 
Then our mouths were filled with laughter;
    our tongues sang for joy.
Then it was said among the nations,
    “The Lord had done great things for them.”
3 
The Lord has done great things for us;
    Oh, how happy we were!
4 
Restore our captives, Lord,
    like the dry stream beds of the Negeb.[b]
II
5 
Those who sow in tears
    will reap with cries of joy.
6 
Those who go forth weeping,
    carrying sacks of seed,
Will return with cries of joy,
    carrying their bundled sheaves.


  Chapter 127.

    1: 
    2: 
The Need of God’s Blessing
1 A song of ascents. Of Solomon.
I
Unless the Lord build the house,
    they labor in vain who build.
Unless the Lord guard the city,
    in vain does the guard keep watch.
2 
It is vain for you to rise early
    and put off your rest at night,
To eat bread earned by hard toil—
    all this God gives to his beloved in sleep.
II

    3: 
Certainly sons are a gift from the Lord,
    the fruit of the womb, a reward.

    4: 
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior
    are the sons born in one’s youth.

    5: 
Blessed is the man who has filled his quiver with them.
He will never be shamed
    for he will destroy his foes at the gate.


  Chapter 128.

    1: 
    2: 
The Blessed Home of the Just
1 A song of ascents.
I
Blessed are all who fear the Lord,
    and who walk in his ways.
2 
What your hands provide you will enjoy;
    you will be blessed and prosper:

    3: 
Your wife will be like a fruitful vine
    within your home,
Your children like young olive plants
    around your table.

    4: 
Just so will the man be blessed
    who fears the Lord.
II

    5: 
May the Lord bless you from Zion;
    may you see Jerusalem’s prosperity
    all the days of your life,

    6: 
    and live to see your children’s children.
Peace upon Israel!
