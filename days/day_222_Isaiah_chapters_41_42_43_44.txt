Day 222:

Reading Isaiah, chapters ['41', '42', '43', '44']:

  Chapter 41.

    1: The Liberator of Israel
1 
Keep silence before me, O coastlands;
    let the nations renew their strength.
Let them draw near and speak;
    let us come together for judgment.

    2: 
Who has stirred up from the East the champion of justice,
    and summoned him to be his attendant?
To him he delivers nations
    and subdues kings;
With his sword he reduces them to dust,
    with his bow, to driven straw.

    3: 
    4: 
The Liberator of Israel
1 
Keep silence before me, O coastlands;
    let the nations renew their strength.
Let them draw near and speak;
    let us come together for judgment.
2 
Who has stirred up from the East the champion of justice,
    and summoned him to be his attendant?
To him he delivers nations
    and subdues kings;
With his sword he reduces them to dust,
    with his bow, to driven straw.
3 
He pursues them, passing on without loss,
    by a path his feet scarcely touch.
4 
Who has performed these deeds?
    Who has called forth the generations from the beginning?
I, the Lord, am the first,
    and at the last[b] I am he.

    5: 
The coastlands see, and fear;
    the ends of the earth tremble:
    they approach, they come on.

    6: 
Each one helps his neighbor,
    one says to the other, “Courage!”

    7: 
The woodworker encourages the goldsmith,
    the one who beats with the hammer, him who strikes on the anvil,
Saying of the soldering, “It is good!”
    then fastening it with nails so it will not totter.

    8: 
But you, Israel, my servant,
    Jacob, whom I have chosen,
    offspring of Abraham my friend—

    9: You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth
    and summoned from its far-off places,
To whom I have said, You are my servant;
    I chose you, I have not rejected you—

    10: 
Do not fear: I am with you;
    do not be anxious: I am your God.
I will strengthen you, I will help you,
    I will uphold you with my victorious right hand.

    11: 
Yes, all shall be put to shame and disgrace
    who vent their anger against you;
Those shall be as nothing and perish
    who offer resistance.

    12: 
You shall seek but not find
    those who strive against you;
They shall be as nothing at all
    who do battle with you.

    13: 
For I am the Lord, your God,
    who grasp your right hand;
It is I who say to you, Do not fear,
    I will help you.

    14: 
Do not fear, you worm Jacob,
    you maggot Israel;
I will help you—oracle of the Lord;
    the Holy One of Israel is your redeemer.

    15: 
I will make of you a threshing sledge,
    sharp, new, full of teeth,
To thresh the mountains and crush them,
    to make the hills like chaff.

    16: 
When you winnow them, the wind shall carry them off,
    the storm shall scatter them.
But you shall rejoice in the Lord;
    in the Holy One of Israel you shall glory.

    17: 
The afflicted and the needy seek water in vain,
    their tongues are parched with thirst.
I, the Lord, will answer them;
    I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.

    18: 
I will open up rivers on the bare heights,
    and fountains in the broad valleys;
I will turn the wilderness into a marshland,
    and the dry ground into springs of water.

    19: 
In the wilderness I will plant the cedar,
    acacia, myrtle, and olive;
In the wasteland I will set the cypress,
    together with the plane tree and the pine,

    20: 
That all may see and know,
    observe and understand,
That the hand of the Lord has done this,
    the Holy One of Israel has created it.

    21: 
Present your case, says the Lord;
    bring forward your arguments, says the King of Jacob.

    22: 
Let them draw near and foretell to us
    what it is that shall happen!
What are the things of long ago?
    Tell us, that we may reflect on them
    and know their outcome;
Or declare to us the things to come,

    23: 
    tell what is to be in the future,
    that we may know that you are gods!
Do something, good or evil,
    that will put us in awe and in fear.

    24: 
Why, you are nothing
    and your work is nought;
    to choose you is an abomination!

    25: 
I have stirred up one from the north, and he comes;
    from the east I summon him by name;
He shall trample the rulers down like mud,
    like a potter treading clay.

    26: 
Who announced this from the beginning, that we might know;
    beforehand, that we might say, “True”?
Not one of you foretold it, not one spoke;
    not one heard you say,

    27: 
“The first news for Zion: here they come,”
    or, “I will give Jerusalem a herald of good news.”

    28: 
When I look, there is not one,
    not one of them to give counsel,
    to make an answer when I question them.

    29: 
Ah, all of them are nothing,
    their works are nought,
    their idols, empty wind!


  Chapter 42.

    1: 
    2: The Servant of the Lord
1 
Here is my servant whom I uphold,
    my chosen one with whom I am pleased.
Upon him I have put my spirit;
    he shall bring forth justice to the nations.
2 
He will not cry out, nor shout,
    nor make his voice heard in the street.

    3: 
    4: 
The Servant of the Lord
1 
Here is my servant whom I uphold,
    my chosen one with whom I am pleased.
Upon him I have put my spirit;
    he shall bring forth justice to the nations.
2 
He will not cry out, nor shout,
    nor make his voice heard in the street.
3 
A bruised reed[b] he will not break,
    and a dimly burning wick he will not quench.
    He will faithfully bring forth justice.
4 
He will not grow dim or be bruised
    until he establishes justice on the earth;
    the coastlands[c] will wait for his teaching.

    5: 
Thus says God, the Lord,
    who created the heavens and stretched them out,
    who spread out the earth and its produce,
Who gives breath to its people
    and spirit to those who walk on it:

    6: 
I, the Lord, have called you for justice,
    I have grasped you by the hand;
I formed you, and set you
    as a covenant for the people,
    a light for the nations,

    7: 
To open the eyes of the blind,
    to bring out prisoners from confinement,
    and from the dungeon, those who live in darkness.

    8: 
I am the Lord, Lord is my name;
    my glory I give to no other,
    nor my praise to idols.

    9: See, the earlier things have come to pass,
    new ones I now declare;
Before they spring forth
    I announce them to you.
The Lord’s Purpose for Israel

    10: 
Sing to the Lord a new song,
    his praise from the ends of the earth:
Let the sea and what fills it resound,
    the coastlands, and those who dwell in them.

    11: 
Let the wilderness and its cities cry out,
    the villages where Kedar dwells;
Let the inhabitants of Sela exult,
    and shout from the top of the mountains.

    12: 
Let them give glory to the Lord,
    and utter his praise in the coastlands.

    13: 
The Lord goes forth like a warrior,
    like a man of war he stirs up his fury;
He shouts out his battle cry,
    against his enemies he shows his might:

    14: 
For a long time I have kept silent,
    I have said nothing, holding myself back;
Now I cry out like a woman in labor,
    gasping and panting.

    15: 
I will lay waste mountains and hills,
    all their undergrowth I will dry up;
I will turn the rivers into marshes,
    and the marshes I will dry up.

    16: 
I will lead the blind on a way they do not know;
    by paths they do not know I will guide them.
I will turn darkness into light before them,
    and make crooked ways straight.
These are my promises:
    I made them, I will not forsake them.

    17: 
They shall be turned back in utter shame
    who trust in idols;
Who say to molten images,
    “You are our gods.”

    18: 
You deaf ones, listen,
    you blind ones, look and see!

    19: 
Who is blind but my servant,
    or deaf like the messenger I send?
Who is blind like the one I restore,
    blind like the servant of the Lord?

    20: 
You see many things but do not observe;
    ears open, but do not hear.

    21: 
It was the Lord’s will for the sake of his justice
    to make his teaching great and glorious.

    22: 
This is a people plundered and despoiled,
    all of them trapped in holes,
    hidden away in prisons.
They are taken as plunder, with no one to rescue them,
    as spoil, with no one to say, “Give back!”

    23: 
Who among you will give ear to this,
    listen and pay attention from now on?

    24: 
Who was it that gave Jacob to be despoiled,
    Israel to the plunderers?
Was it not the Lord, against whom we have sinned?
    In his ways they refused to walk,
    his teaching they would not heed.

    25: 
So he poured out wrath upon them,
    his anger, and the fury of battle;
It blazed all around them, yet they did not realize,
    it burned them, but they did not take it to heart.


  Chapter 43.

    1: 
But now, thus says the Lord,
    who created you, Jacob, and formed you, Israel:
Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;
    I have called you by name: you are mine.

    2: 
    3: 
    4: 
Promises of Redemption and Restoration
1 
But now, thus says the Lord,
    who created you, Jacob, and formed you, Israel:
Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;
    I have called you by name: you are mine.
2 
When you pass through waters, I will be with you;
    through rivers, you shall not be swept away.
When you walk through fire, you shall not be burned,
    nor will flames consume you.
3 
For I, the Lord, am your God,
    the Holy One of Israel, your savior.
I give Egypt as ransom for you,
    Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you.
4 
Because you are precious in my eyes
    and honored, and I love you,
I give people in return for you
    and nations in exchange for your life.

    5: 
Fear not, for I am with you;
    from the east I will bring back your offspring,
    from the west I will gather you.

    6: 
I will say to the north: Give them up!
    and to the south: Do not hold them!
Bring back my sons from afar,
    and my daughters from the ends of the earth:

    7: 
All who are called by my name
    I created for my glory;
    I formed them, made them.

    8: 
Lead out the people, blind though they have eyes,
    deaf though they have ears.

    9: Let all the nations gather together,
    let the peoples assemble!
Who among them could have declared this,
    or announced to us the earlier things?
Let them produce witnesses to prove themselves right,
    that one may hear and say, “It is true!”

    10: 
You are my witnesses—oracle of the Lord—
    my servant whom I have chosen
To know and believe in me
    and understand that I am he.
Before me no god was formed,
    and after me there shall be none.

    11: 
I, I am the Lord;
    there is no savior but me.

    12: 
It is I who declared, who saved,
    who announced, not some strange god among you;
You are my witnesses—oracle of the Lord.
    I am God,

    13: 
    yes, from eternity I am he;
There is none who can deliver from my hand:
    I act and who can cancel it?

    14: 
Thus says the Lord, your redeemer,
    the Holy One of Israel:
For your sake I send to Babylon;
    I will bring down all her defenses,
    and the Chaldeans shall cry out in lamentation.

    15: 
I am the Lord, your Holy One,
    the creator of Israel, your King.

    16: 
Thus says the Lord,
    who opens a way in the sea,
    a path in the mighty waters,

    17: 
Who leads out chariots and horsemen,
    a powerful army,
Till they lie prostrate together, never to rise,
    snuffed out, quenched like a wick.

    18: 
Remember not the events of the past,
    the things of long ago consider not;

    19: 
See, I am doing something new!
    Now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?
In the wilderness I make a way,
    in the wasteland, rivers.

    20: 
Wild beasts honor me,
    jackals and ostriches,
For I put water in the wilderness
    and rivers in the wasteland
    for my chosen people to drink,

    21: 
The people whom I formed for myself,
    that they might recount my praise.

    22: 
Yet you did not call upon me, Jacob,
    for you grew weary of me, Israel.

    23: 
You did not bring me sheep for your burnt offerings,
    nor honor me with your sacrifices.
I did not exact from you the service of offerings,
    nor weary you for frankincense.

    24: 
You did not buy me sweet cane,
    nor did you fill me with the fat of your sacrifices;
Instead, you burdened me with your sins,
    wearied me with your crimes.

    25: 
It is I, I, who wipe out,
    for my own sake, your offenses;
    your sins I remember no more.

    26: 
Would you have me remember, have us come to trial?
    Speak up, prove your innocence!

    27: 
Your first father sinned;
    your spokesmen rebelled against me

    28: 
Till I repudiated the holy princes,
    put Jacob under the ban,
    exposed Israel to scorn.


  Chapter 44.

    1: 
Hear then, Jacob, my servant,
    Israel, whom I have chosen.

    2: 
Thus says the Lord who made you,
    your help, who formed you from the womb:
Do not fear, Jacob, my servant,
    Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.

    3: 
    4: 
1 
Hear then, Jacob, my servant,
    Israel, whom I have chosen.
2 
Thus says the Lord who made you,
    your help, who formed you from the womb:
Do not fear, Jacob, my servant,
    Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
3 
I will pour out water upon the thirsty ground,
    streams upon the dry land;
I will pour out my spirit upon your offspring,
    my blessing upon your descendants.
4 
They shall spring forth amid grass
    like poplars beside flowing waters.

    5: 
One shall say, “I am the Lord’s,”
    another shall be named after Jacob,
And this one shall write on his hand, “The Lord’s,”
    and receive the name Israel.
The True God and False Gods

    6: 
Thus says the Lord, Israel’s king,
    its redeemer, the Lord of hosts:
I am the first, I am the last;
    there is no God but me.[d]

    7: 
Who is like me? Let him stand up and declare,
    make it evident, and confront me with it.
Who of old announced future events?
    Let them foretell to us the things to come.

    8: 
Do not fear or be troubled.
Did I not announce it to you long ago?
    I declared it, and you are my witnesses.
Is there any God but me?
    There is no other Rock, I know of none!

    9: Those who fashion idols are all nothing;
    their precious works are of no avail.
They are their witnesses:[g]
    they see nothing, know nothing,
    and so they are put to shame.

    10: 
Who would fashion a god or cast an idol,
    that is of no use?

    11: 
Look, all its company will be shamed;
    they are artisans, mere human beings!
They all assemble and stand there,
    only to cower in shame.

    12: 
The ironsmith fashions a likeness,
    he works it over the coals,
Shaping it with hammers,
    working it with his strong arm.
With hunger his strength wanes,
    without water, he grows faint.

    13: 
The woodworker stretches a line,
    and marks out a shape with a stylus.
He shapes it with scraping tools,
    with a compass measures it off,
Making it the copy of a man,
    human display, enthroned in a shrine.

    14: 
He goes out to cut down cedars,
    takes a holm tree or an oak.
He picks out for himself trees of the forest,
    plants a fir, and the rain makes it grow.

    15: 
It is used for fuel:
    with some of the wood he warms himself,
    makes a fire and bakes bread.
Yet he makes a god and worships it,
    turns it into an idol and adores it!

    16: 
Half of it he burns in the fire,
    on its embers he roasts meat;
    he eats the roast and is full.
He warms himself and says, “Ah!
    I am warm! I see the flames!”

    17: 
The rest of it he makes into a god,
    an image to worship and adore.
He prays to it and says,
    “Help me! You are my god!”

    18: 
They do not know, do not understand;
    their eyes are too clouded to see,
    their minds, to perceive.

    19: 
He does not think clearly;
    he lacks the wit and knowledge to say,
“Half the wood I burned in the fire,
    on its embers I baked bread,
    I roasted meat and ate.
Shall I turn the rest into an abomination?
    Shall I worship a block of wood?”

    20: 
He is chasing ashes!
A deluded mind has led him astray;
    He cannot save himself,
    does not say, “This thing in my right hand—is it not a fraud?”

    21: 
Remember these things, Jacob,
    Israel, for you are my servant!
I formed you, a servant to me;
    Israel, you shall never be forgotten by me:

    22: 
I have brushed away your offenses like a cloud,
    your sins like a mist;
    return to me, for I have redeemed you.

    23: 
Raise a glad cry, you heavens—the Lord has acted!
    Shout, you depths of the earth.
Break forth, mountains, into song,
    forest, with all your trees.
For the Lord has redeemed Jacob,
    shows his glory through Israel.
Cyrus, Anointed of the Lord, Agent of Israel’s Liberation

    24: 
Thus says the Lord, your redeemer,
    who formed you from the womb:
I am the Lord, who made all things,
    who alone stretched out the heavens,
    I spread out the earth by myself.

    25: 
I bring to nought the omens of babblers,
    make fools of diviners,
Turn back the wise
    and make their knowledge foolish.

    26: 
I confirm the words of my servant,
    carry out the plan my messengers announce.
I say to Jerusalem, Be inhabited!
    To the cities of Judah, Be rebuilt!
    I will raise up their ruins.

    27: 
I say to the deep, Be dry!
    I will dry up your rivers.

    28: 
I say of Cyrus, My shepherd!
    He carries out my every wish,
Saying of Jerusalem, “Let it be rebuilt,”
    and of the temple, “Lay its foundations.”
