Day 337:

Reading Titus, chapters ['1', '2', '3']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: Greeting. 1 Paul, a slave of God and apostle of Jesus Christ for the sake of the faith of God’s chosen ones and the recognition of religious truth, 
    2: in the hope of eternal life that God, who does not lie, promised before time began, 
    3: who indeed at the proper time revealed his word in the proclamation with which I was entrusted by the command of God our savior, 
    4: to Titus, my true child in our common faith: grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our savior.
II. Pastoral Charge
Titus in Crete. 
    5: For this reason I left you in Crete so that you might set right what remains to be done and appoint presbyters in every town, as I directed you, 
    6: on condition that a man be blameless, married only once, with believing children who are not accused of licentiousness or rebellious. 
    7: For a bishop as God’s steward must be blameless, not arrogant, not irritable, not a drunkard, not aggressive, not greedy for sordid gain, 
    8: but hospitable, a lover of goodness, temperate, just, holy, and self-controlled, 
    9: olding fast to the true message as taught so that he will be able both to exhort with sound doctrine and to refute opponents. 
    10: For there are also many rebels, idle talkers and deceivers, especially the Jewish Christians.[d] 
    11: It is imperative to silence them, as they are upsetting whole families by teaching for sordid gain what they should not. 
    12: One of them, a prophet of their own, once said, “Cretans have always been liars, vicious beasts, and lazy gluttons.” 
    13: That testimony is true. Therefore, admonish them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith, 
    14: instead of paying attention to Jewish myths and regulations of people who have repudiated the truth. 
    15: To the clean all things are clean, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is clean; in fact, both their minds and their consciences are tainted. 
    16: They claim to know God, but by their deeds they deny him. They are vile and disobedient and unqualified for any good deed.


  Chapter 2.

    1: 
    2: Christian Behavior. 1 As for yourself, you must say what is consistent with sound doctrine, namely, 2 that older men should be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, love, and endurance. 
    3: Similarly, older women should be reverent in their behavior, not slanderers, not addicted to drink, teaching what is good, 
    4: so that they may train younger women to love their husbands and children, 
    5: to be self-controlled, chaste, good homemakers, under the control of their husbands, so that the word of God may not be discredited.

    6: Urge the younger men, similarly, to control themselves, 
    7: showing yourself as a model of good deeds in every respect, with integrity in your teaching, dignity, 
    8: and sound speech that cannot be criticized, so that the opponent will be put to shame without anything bad to say about us.

    9: laves are to be under the control of their masters in all respects, giving them satisfaction, not talking back to them 
    10: or stealing from them, but exhibiting complete good faith, so as to adorn the doctrine of God our savior in every way.
Transformation of Life. 
    11: For the grace of God has appeared, saving all 
    12: and training us to reject godless ways and worldly desires and to live temperately, justly, and devoutly in this age, 
    13: as we await the blessed hope, the appearance of the glory of the great God and of our savior Jesus Christ, 
    14: who gave himself for us to deliver us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people as his own, eager to do what is good.

    15: Say these things. Exhort and correct with all authority. Let no one look down on you.


  Chapter 3.

    1: Remind them to be under the control of magistrates and authorities,[b] to be obedient, to be open to every good enterprise. 
    2: 
    3: 1 Remind them to be under the control of magistrates and authorities,[b] to be obedient, to be open to every good enterprise. 2 They are to slander no one, to be peaceable, considerate, exercising all graciousness toward everyone. 3 For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, deluded, slaves to various desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful ourselves and hating one another.

    4: 
But when the kindness and generous love
    of God our savior appeared,

    5: 
not because of any righteous deeds we had done
    but because of his mercy,
he saved us through the bath of rebirth
    and renewal by the holy Spirit,

    6: 
whom he richly poured out on us
    through Jesus Christ our savior,

    7: 
so that we might be justified by his grace
    and become heirs in hope of eternal life.

    8: This saying is trustworthy.
Advice to Titus. I want you to insist on these points, that those who have believed in God be careful to devote themselves to good works; these are excellent and beneficial to others. 
    9: d]Avoid foolish arguments, genealogies, rivalries, and quarrels about the law, for they are useless and futile. 
    10: After a first and second warning, break off contact with a heretic, 
    11: realizing that such a person is perverted and sinful and stands self-condemned.
Directives, Greetings, and Blessing. 
    12: When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, try to join me at Nicopolis, where I have decided to spend the winter. 
    13: Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey soon, and see to it that they have everything they need. 
    14: But let our people, too, learn to devote themselves to good works to supply urgent needs, so that they may not be unproductive.

    15: All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith.
Grace be with all of you.
