Day 226:

Reading Isaiah, chapters ['57', '58', '59', '60']:

  Chapter 57.

    1: 
The just have perished,
    but no one takes it to heart;
The steadfast are swept away,
    while no one understands.
Yet the just are taken away from the presence of evil,

    2: 
    and enter into peace;
They rest upon their couches,
    the sincere, who walk in integrity.
An Idolatrous People[b]

    3: 
But you, draw near,
    you children of a sorceress,
    offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute!

    4: 
    5: 
1 
The just have perished,
    but no one takes it to heart;
The steadfast are swept away,
    while no one understands.
Yet the just are taken away from the presence of evil,
2 
    and enter into peace;
They rest upon their couches,
    the sincere, who walk in integrity.
An Idolatrous People[b]
3 
But you, draw near,
    you children of a sorceress,
    offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute![c]
4 
Against whom do you make sport,
    against whom do you open wide your mouth,
    and stick out your tongue?
Are you not rebellious children,
    deceitful offspring—
5 
You who burn with lust among the oaks,
    under every green tree;
You who immolate children in the wadies,
    among the clefts of the rocks?[d]

    6: 
    7: 1 
The just have perished,
    but no one takes it to heart;
The steadfast are swept away,
    while no one understands.
Yet the just are taken away from the presence of evil,
2 
    and enter into peace;
They rest upon their couches,
    the sincere, who walk in integrity.
An Idolatrous People[b]
3 
But you, draw near,
    you children of a sorceress,
    offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute![c]
4 
Against whom do you make sport,
    against whom do you open wide your mouth,
    and stick out your tongue?
Are you not rebellious children,
    deceitful offspring—
5 
You who burn with lust among the oaks,
    under every green tree;
You who immolate children in the wadies,
    among the clefts of the rocks?[d]
6 
Among the smooth stones[e] of the wadi is your portion,
    they, they are your allotment;
Indeed, you poured out a drink offering to them,
    and brought up grain offerings.
    With these things, should I be appeased?
7 
Upon a towering and lofty mountain
    you set up your bed,
    and there you went up to offer sacrifice.

    8: 
Behind the door and the doorpost
    you set up your symbol.
Yes, deserting me, you carried up your bedding;
    and spread it wide.
You entered an agreement with them,
    you loved their couch, you gazed upon nakedness.

    9: You approached the king with oil,
    and multiplied your perfumes;
You sent your ambassadors far away,
    down even to deepest Sheol.

    10: 
Though worn out with the length of your journey,
    you never said, “It is hopeless”;
You found your strength revived,
    and so you did not weaken.

    11: 
Whom did you dread and fear,
    that you told lies,
And me you did not remember
    nor take to heart?
Am I to keep silent and conceal,
    while you show no fear of me?

    12: 
I will proclaim your justice
    and your works;
    but they shall not help you.

    13: 
When you cry out,
    let your collection of idols save you.
All these the wind shall carry off,
    a mere breath shall bear them away;
But whoever takes refuge in me shall inherit the land,
    and possess my holy mountain.
The Way to Peace for God’s People

    14: 
And I say:
Build up, build up, prepare the way,
    remove every obstacle from my people’s way.

    15: 
For thus says the high and lofty One,
    the One who dwells forever, whose name is holy:
I dwell in a high and holy place,
    but also with the contrite and lowly of spirit,
To revive the spirit of the lowly,
    to revive the heart of the crushed.

    16: 
For I will not accuse forever,
    nor always be angry;
For without me their spirit fails,
    the life breath that I have given.

    17: 
Because of their wicked avarice I grew angry;
    I struck them, hiding myself from them in wrath.
But they turned back, following the way
    of their own heart.

    18: 
I saw their ways,
    but I will heal them.
I will lead them and restore full comfort to them
    and to those who mourn for them,

    19: 
    creating words of comfort.
Peace! Peace to those who are far and near,
    says the Lord; and I will heal them.

    20: 
But the wicked are like the tossing sea
    which cannot be still,
Its waters cast up mire and mud.

    21: 
    There is no peace for the wicked!
    says my God.


  Chapter 58.

    1: 
Cry out full-throated and unsparingly,
    lift up your voice like a trumpet blast;
Proclaim to my people their transgression,
    to the house of Jacob their sins.

    2: 
They seek me day after day,
    and desire to know my ways,
Like a nation that has done what is just
    and not abandoned the judgment of their God;
They ask of me just judgments,
    they desire to draw near to God.

    3: 
“Why do we fast, but you do not see it?
    afflict ourselves, but you take no note?”
See, on your fast day you carry out your own pursuits,
    and drive all your laborers.

    4: 
    5: 
Reasons for Judgment
1 
Cry out full-throated and unsparingly,
    lift up your voice like a trumpet blast;
Proclaim to my people their transgression,
    to the house of Jacob their sins.
2 
They seek me day after day,
    and desire to know my ways,
Like a nation that has done what is just
    and not abandoned the judgment of their God;
They ask of me just judgments,
    they desire to draw near to God.
3 
“Why do we fast, but you do not see it?
    afflict ourselves, but you take no note?”
See, on your fast day you carry out your own pursuits,
    and drive all your laborers.
4 
See, you fast only to quarrel and fight
    and to strike with a wicked fist!
Do not fast as you do today
    to make your voice heard on high!
5 
Is this the manner of fasting I would choose,
    a day to afflict oneself?
To bow one’s head like a reed,
    and lie upon sackcloth and ashes?
Is this what you call a fast,
    a day acceptable to the Lord?
Authentic Fasting That Leads to Blessing[b]

    6: 
Is this not, rather, the fast that I choose:
    releasing those bound unjustly,
    untying the thongs of the yoke;
Setting free the oppressed,
    breaking off every yoke?

    7: 
    8: Reasons for Judgment
1 
Cry out full-throated and unsparingly,
    lift up your voice like a trumpet blast;
Proclaim to my people their transgression,
    to the house of Jacob their sins.
2 
They seek me day after day,
    and desire to know my ways,
Like a nation that has done what is just
    and not abandoned the judgment of their God;
They ask of me just judgments,
    they desire to draw near to God.
3 
“Why do we fast, but you do not see it?
    afflict ourselves, but you take no note?”
See, on your fast day you carry out your own pursuits,
    and drive all your laborers.
4 
See, you fast only to quarrel and fight
    and to strike with a wicked fist!
Do not fast as you do today
    to make your voice heard on high!
5 
Is this the manner of fasting I would choose,
    a day to afflict oneself?
To bow one’s head like a reed,
    and lie upon sackcloth and ashes?
Is this what you call a fast,
    a day acceptable to the Lord?
Authentic Fasting That Leads to Blessing[b]
6 
Is this not, rather, the fast that I choose:
    releasing those bound unjustly,
    untying the thongs of the yoke;
Setting free the oppressed,
    breaking off every yoke?
7 
Is it not sharing your bread with the hungry,
    bringing the afflicted and the homeless into your house;
Clothing the naked when you see them,
    and not turning your back on your own flesh?
8 
Then your light shall break forth like the dawn,
    and your wound shall quickly be healed;
Your vindication shall go before you,
    and the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard.

    9: Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer,
    you shall cry for help, and he will say: “Here I am!”
If you remove the yoke from among you,
    the accusing finger, and malicious speech;

    10: 
If you lavish your food on the hungry
    and satisfy the afflicted;
Then your light shall rise in the darkness,
    and your gloom shall become like midday;

    11: 
Then the Lord will guide you always
    and satisfy your thirst in parched places,
    will give strength to your bones
And you shall be like a watered garden,
    like a flowing spring whose waters never fail.

    12: 
Your people shall rebuild the ancient ruins;
    the foundations from ages past you shall raise up;
“Repairer of the breach,” they shall call you,
    “Restorer of ruined dwellings.”
Authentic Sabbath Observance That Leads to Blessing

    13: 
If you refrain from trampling the sabbath,
    from following your own pursuits on my holy day;
If you call the sabbath a delight,
    the Lord’s holy day glorious;
If you glorify it by not following your ways,
    seeking your own interests, or pursuing your own affairs—

    14: 
Then you shall delight in the Lord,
    and I will make you ride upon the heights of the earth;
I will nourish you with the heritage of Jacob, your father,
    for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.


  Chapter 59.

    1: 
No, the hand of the Lord is not too short to save,
    nor his ear too dull to hear.

    2: 
Rather, it is your crimes
    that separate you from your God,
It is your sins that make him hide his face
    so that he does not hear you.

    3: 
For your hands are defiled with blood,
    and your fingers with crime;
Your lips speak falsehood,
    and your tongue utters deceit.

    4: 
    5: 
Salvation Delayed
1 
No, the hand of the Lord is not too short to save,
    nor his ear too dull to hear.
2 
Rather, it is your crimes
    that separate you from your God,
It is your sins that make him hide his face
    so that he does not hear you.
3 
For your hands are defiled with blood,
    and your fingers with crime;
Your lips speak falsehood,
    and your tongue utters deceit.
4 
No one brings suit justly,
    no one pleads truthfully;
They trust an empty plea and tell lies;
    they conceive mischief and bring forth malice.
5 
[b]They hatch adders’ eggs,
    and weave spiders’ webs:
Whoever eats the eggs will die,
    if one of them is crushed, it will hatch a viper;

    6: 
Their webs cannot serve as clothing,
    nor can they cover themselves with their works.
Their works are evil works,
    and deeds of violence are in their hands.

    7: 
Their feet run to evil,
    and they hasten to shed innocent blood;
Their thoughts are thoughts of wickedness,
    violence and destruction are on their highways.

    8: 
    9: alvation Delayed
1 
No, the hand of the Lord is not too short to save,
    nor his ear too dull to hear.
2 
Rather, it is your crimes
    that separate you from your God,
It is your sins that make him hide his face
    so that he does not hear you.
3 
For your hands are defiled with blood,
    and your fingers with crime;
Your lips speak falsehood,
    and your tongue utters deceit.
4 
No one brings suit justly,
    no one pleads truthfully;
They trust an empty plea and tell lies;
    they conceive mischief and bring forth malice.
5 
[b]They hatch adders’ eggs,
    and weave spiders’ webs:
Whoever eats the eggs will die,
    if one of them is crushed, it will hatch a viper;
6 
Their webs cannot serve as clothing,
    nor can they cover themselves with their works.
Their works are evil works,
    and deeds of violence are in their hands.
7 
Their feet run to evil,
    and they hasten to shed innocent blood;
Their thoughts are thoughts of wickedness,
    violence and destruction are on their highways.
8 
The way of peace they know not,
    and there is no justice on their paths;
Their roads they have made crooked,
    no one who walks in them knows peace.
Acknowledgment of Transgressions
9 
[c]That is why judgment is far from us
    and justice does not reach us.
We look for light, but there is darkness;
    for brightness, and we walk in gloom!

    10: 
Like those who are blind we grope along the wall,
    like people without eyes we feel our way.
We stumble at midday as if at twilight,
    among the vigorous, we are like the dead.

    11: 
Like bears we all growl,
    like doves we moan without ceasing.
We cry out for justice, but it is not there;
    for salvation, but it is far from us.

    12: 
For our transgressions before you are many,
    our sins bear witness against us.
Our transgressions are present to us,
    and our crimes we acknowledge:

    13: 
Transgressing, and denying the Lord,
    turning back from following our God,
Planning fraud and treachery,
    uttering lying words conceived in the heart.

    14: 
Judgment is turned away,
    and justice stands far off;
For truth stumbles in the public square,
    and uprightness cannot enter.

    15: 
Fidelity is lacking,
    and whoever turns from evil is despoiled.
Divine Intervention
The Lord saw this, and was aggrieved
    that there was no justice.

    16: 
He saw that there was no one,
    was appalled that there was none to intervene;
Then his own arm brought about the victory,
    and his justice sustained him.

    17: 
He put on justice as his breastplate,
    victory as a helmet on his head;
He clothed himself with garments of vengeance,
    wrapped himself in a mantle of zeal.

    18: 
According to their deeds he repays his enemies
    and requites his foes with wrath;
    to the coastlands he renders recompense.

    19: 
Those in the west shall fear the name of the Lord,
    and those in the east, his glory,
Coming like a pent-up stream
    driven on by the breath of the Lord.

    20: 
Then for Zion shall come a redeemer,
    to those in Jacob who turn from transgression—oracle of the Lord.

    21: 
This is my covenant with them,
    which I myself have made, says the Lord:
My spirit which is upon you
    and my words that I have put in your mouth
Shall not depart from your mouth,
    nor from the mouths of your children
Nor the mouths of your children’s children
    from this time forth and forever, says the Lord.


  Chapter 60.

    1: 
Arise! Shine, for your light has come,
    the glory of the Lord has dawned upon you.

    2: 
Though darkness covers the earth,
    and thick clouds, the peoples,
Upon you the Lord will dawn,
    and over you his glory will be seen.

    3: 
Nations shall walk by your light,
    kings by the radiance of your dawning.
The Nations Come to Zion

    4: 
Raise your eyes and look about;
    they all gather and come to you—
Your sons from afar,
    your daughters in the arms of their nurses.

    5: 
    6: 
The Dawning of Divine Glory for Zion
1 
Arise! Shine, for your light has come,
    the glory of the Lord has dawned upon you.
2 
Though darkness covers the earth,
    and thick clouds, the peoples,
Upon you the Lord will dawn,
    and over you his glory will be seen.
3 
Nations shall walk by your light,
    kings by the radiance of your dawning.
The Nations Come to Zion
4 
Raise your eyes and look about;
    they all gather and come to you—
Your sons from afar,
    your daughters in the arms of their nurses.
5 
Then you shall see and be radiant,
    your heart shall throb and overflow.
For the riches of the sea shall be poured out before you,
    the wealth of nations shall come to you.
6 
Caravans of camels shall cover you,
    dromedaries of Midian and Ephah;
All from Sheba shall come
    bearing gold and frankincense,
    and heralding the praises of the Lord.

    7: 
All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered for you,
    the rams of Nebaioth shall serve your needs;
They will be acceptable offerings on my altar,
    and I will glorify my glorious house.

    8: 
Who are these that fly along like a cloud,
    like doves to their cotes?

    9: The vessels of the coastlands are gathering,
    with the ships of Tarshish in the lead,
To bring your children from afar,
    their silver and gold with them—
For the name of the Lord, your God,
    for the Holy One of Israel who has glorified you.
Honor and Service for Zion

    10: 
Foreigners shall rebuild your walls,
    their kings shall minister to you;
Though in my wrath I struck you,
    yet in my good will I have shown you mercy.

    11: 
Your gates shall stand open constantly;
    day and night they shall not be closed
So that they may bring you the wealth of nations,
    with their kings in the vanguard.

    12: 
For the nation or kingdom that will not serve you shall perish;
    such nations shall be utterly destroyed!

    13: 
The glory of Lebanon shall come to you—
    the juniper, the fir, and the cypress all together—
To bring beauty to my sanctuary,
    and glory to the place where I stand.

    14: 
The children of your oppressors shall come,
    bowing before you;
All those who despised you,
    shall bow low at your feet.
They shall call you “City of the Lord,”
    “Zion of the Holy One of Israel.”

    15: 
No longer forsaken and hated,
    with no one passing through,
Now I will make you the pride of the ages,
    a joy from generation to generation.

    16: 
You shall suck the milk of nations,
    and be nursed at royal breasts;
And you shall know that I, the Lord, am your savior,
    your redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

    17: 
Instead of bronze I will bring gold,
    instead of iron I will bring silver;
Instead of wood, bronze;
    instead of stones, iron.
I will appoint peace your governor,
    and justice your ruler.

    18: 
No longer shall violence be heard of in your land,
    or plunder and ruin within your borders.
You shall call your walls “Salvation”
    and your gates “Praise.”
Eternal Light for Zion

    19: 
No longer shall the sun
    be your light by day,
Nor shall the brightness of the moon
    give you light by night;
Rather, the Lord will be your light forever,
    your God will be your glory.

    20: 
No longer will your sun set,
    or your moon wane;
For the Lord will be your light forever,
    and the days of your grieving will be over.

    21: 
Your people will all be just;
    for all time they will possess the land;
They are the shoot that I planted,
    the work of my hands, that I might be glorified.

    22: 
The least one shall become a clan,
    the smallest, a mighty nation;
I, the Lord, will swiftly accomplish
    these things when the time comes.
