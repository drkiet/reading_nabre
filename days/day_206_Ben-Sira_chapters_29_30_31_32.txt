Day 206:

Reading Ben-Sira, chapters ['29', '30', '31', '32']:

  Chapter 29.

    1: 
    2: 
Loans, Alms and Surety
1 
The merciful lend to their neighbor,
    by holding out a helping hand, they keep the commandments.
2 
Lend to your neighbor in his time of need,
    and pay back your neighbor in time.

    3: 
Keep your promise and be honest with him,
    and at all times you will find what you need.

    4: 
Many borrowers ask for a loan
    and cause trouble for those who help them.

    5: 
Till he gets a loan, he kisses the lender’s hand
    and speaks softly of his creditor’s money,
But at time of payment, delays,
    makes excuses, and finds fault with the timing.

    6: 
If he can pay, the lender will recover barely half,
    and will consider that a windfall.
If he cannot pay, the lender is cheated of his money
    and acquires an enemy at no extra charge;
With curses and insults the borrower will repay,
    and instead of honor will repay with abuse.

    7: 
Many refuse to lend, not out of meanness,
    but from fear of being cheated needlessly.

7 
Many refuse to lend, not out of meanness,
    but from fear of being cheated needlessly.
8 
But with those in humble circumstances be patient;
    do not keep them waiting for your alms.
9 
Because of the commandment, help the poor,
    and in their need, do not send them away empty-handed.

    10: 
Lose your money for relative or friend;
    do not hide it under a stone to rot.

    11: 
Dispose of your treasure according to the commandments of the Most High,
    and that will profit you more than the gold.

    12: 
Store up almsgiving in your treasury,
    and it will save you from every evil.

    13: 
Better than a mighty shield and a sturdy spear
    it will fight for you against the enemy.

    14: 
A good person will be surety for a neighbor,
    but whoever has lost a sense of shame will fail him.

    15: 
Do not forget the kindness of your backer,
    for he has given his very life for you.

    16: 
A sinner will turn the favor of a pledge into misfortune,

    17: 
    and the ungrateful will abandon his rescuer.

    18: 
Going surety has ruined many who were prosperous
    and tossed them about like waves of the sea;
It has exiled the prominent
    and sent them wandering through foreign lands.

    19: 
The sinner will come to grief through surety,
    and whoever undertakes too much will fall into lawsuits.

    20: 
Help your neighbor according to your means,
    but take care lest you fall yourself.
Frugality and Its Rewards

    21: 
Life’s prime needs are water, bread, and clothing,
    and also a house for decent privacy.

    22: 
Better is the life of the poor under the shadow of their own roof
    than sumptuous banquets among strangers.

    23: 
Whether little or much, be content with what you have:
    then you will hear no reproach as a parasite.

    24: 
It is a miserable life to go from house to house,
    for where you are a guest you dare not open your mouth.

    25: 
You will entertain and provide drink without being thanked;
    besides, you will hear these bitter words:

    26: 
“Come here, you parasite, set the table,
    let me eat the food you have there!

    27: 
Go away, you parasite, for one more worthy;
    for my relative’s visit I need the room!”

    than sumptuous banquets among strangers.

28 
Painful things to a sensitive person
    are rebuke as a parasite and insults from creditors.


  Chapter 30.

    1: 
Whoever loves a son will chastise him often,
    that he may be his joy when he grows up.

    2: 
    3: 
The Training of Children
1 
Whoever loves a son will chastise him often,
    that he may be his joy when he grows up.
2 
Whoever disciplines a son will benefit from him,
    and boast of him among acquaintances.
3 
Whoever educates a son will make his enemy jealous,
    and rejoice in him among his friends.

    4: 
At the father’s death, he will seem not dead,
    for he leaves after him one like himself,

    5: 
Whom he looked upon through life with joy,
    and in death, without regret.

    6: 
Against his enemies he has left an avenger,
    and one to repay his friends with kindness.

    7: 
Whoever spoils a son will have wounds to bandage,
    and will suffer heartache at every cry.

    8: 
An untamed horse turns out stubborn;
    and a son left to himself grows up unruly.

    9: Pamper a child and he will be a terror for you,
    indulge him, and he will bring you grief.

    10: 
Do not laugh with him lest you share sorrow with him,
    and in the end you will gnash your teeth.

    11: 
Do not give him his own way in his youth,
    and do not ignore his follies.

    12: 
Bow down his head in his youth,
    beat his sides while he is still young,
Lest he become stubborn and disobey you,
    and leave you disconsolate.

    13: 
Discipline your son and make heavy his yoke,
    lest you be offended by his shamelessness.
Health and Cheerfulness

    14: 
Better the poor in vigorous health
    than the rich with bodily ills.

    15: 
I would rather have bodily health than any gold,
    and contentment of spirit than pearls.

    16: 
No riches are greater than a healthy body;
    and no happiness than a joyful heart.

    17: 
Better is death than a wretched life,
    everlasting sleep than constant illness.

    18: 
Good things set before one who cannot eat
    are like food offerings placed before a tomb.

    19: 
What good is an offering to an idol
    that can neither eat nor smell?
So it is with the one being punished by the Lord,

    20: 
    who groans at what his eyes behold.

    21: 
Do not give in to sadness,
    or torment yourself deliberately.

    22: 
Gladness of heart is the very life of a person,
    and cheerfulness prolongs his days.

    23: 
Distract yourself and renew your courage,
    drive resentment far away from you;
For grief has killed many,
    and nothing is to be gained from resentment.

    24: 
Envy and anger shorten one’s days,
    and anxiety brings on premature old age.

    25: 
Those who are cheerful and merry at table
    benefit from their food.

    1: The Proper Attitude Toward Riches
1 
Wakefulness over wealth wastes away the flesh,
    and anxiety over it drives away sleep.

    3: 
The Proper Attitude Toward Riches
1 
Wakefulness over wealth wastes away the flesh,
    and anxiety over it drives away sleep.
2 
Wakeful anxiety banishes slumber;
    more than a serious illness it disturbs repose.
3 
The rich labor to pile up wealth,
    and if they rest, it is to enjoy pleasure;

    4: 
The poor labor for a meager living,
    and if they ever rest, they become needy.

    5: 
The lover of gold will not be free from sin;
    whoever pursues money will be led astray by it.

    6: 
Many have come to ruin for the sake of gold,
    yet destruction lay before their very eyes;

    7: 
It is a stumbling block for fools;
    any simpleton will be ensnared by it.

    8: 
Happy the rich person found without fault,
    who does not turn aside after wealth.

    9: Who is he, that we may praise him?
    For he has done wonders among his people.

    10: 
Who has been tested by gold and been found perfect?
    Let it be for him his glory;
Who could have sinned but did not,
    and could have done evil but did not?

    11: 
So his good fortune is secure,
    and the assembly will recount his praises.
Table Etiquette

    12: 
Are you seated at the table of the great?
    Bring to it no greedy gullet,
Nor say, “How much food there is here!”

    13: 
    Remember that the greedy eye is evil.
What has been created more greedy than the eye?
    Therefore, it weeps for any cause.
15 
Recognize that your neighbor feels as you do,
    and keep in mind everything you dislike.

    14: 
    15: 
Recognize that your neighbor feels as you do,
    and keep in mind everything you dislike.
14 
Toward what he looks at, do not put out a hand;
    nor reach for the same dish when he does.

    16: 
Eat, like anyone else, what is set before you,
    but do not eat greedily, lest you be despised.

    17: 
Be the first to stop, as befits good manners;
    and do not gorge yourself, lest you give offense.

    18: 
If there are many with you at table,
    do not be the first to stretch out your hand.

    19: 
Does not a little suffice for a well-bred person?
    When he lies down, he does not wheeze.

    20: 
Moderate eating ensures sound slumber
    and a clear mind on rising the next day.
The distress of sleeplessness and of nausea
    and colic are with the glutton!

    21: 
Should you have eaten too much,
    get up to vomit and you will have relief.

    22: 
Listen to me, my child, and do not scorn me;
    later you will find my advice good.
In whatever you do, be moderate,
    and no sickness will befall you.

    23: 
People bless one who is generous with food,
    and this testimony to his goodness is lasting.

    24: 
The city complains about one who is stingy with food,
    and this testimony to his stinginess is lasting.

    25: 
Let not wine be the proof of your strength,
    for wine has been the ruin of many.

    26: 
As the furnace tests the work of the smith,
    so does wine the hearts of the insolent.

    27: 
Wine is very life to anyone,
    if taken in moderation.
Does anyone really live who lacks the wine
    which from the beginning was created for joy?

    28: 
Joy of heart, good cheer, and delight
    is wine enough, drunk at the proper time.

    29: 
Headache, bitterness, and disgrace
    is wine drunk amid anger and strife.

Wine in excess is a snare for the fool;
    it lessens strength and multiplies wounds.
31 
Do not wrangle with your neighbor when wine is served,
    nor despise him while he is having a good time;
Say no harsh words to him
    nor distress him by making demands.


  Chapter 32.

    1: 
    2: 
    3: 
1 
If you are chosen to preside at a dinner, do not be puffed up,
    but with the guests be as one of them;
Take care of them first and then sit down;
2 
    see to their needs, and then take your place,
To share in their joy
    and receive a wreath for a job well done.
3 
You who are older, it is your right to speak,
    but temper your knowledge and do not interrupt the singing.

    4: 
Where there is entertainment, do not pour out discourse,
    and do not display your wisdom at the wrong time.

    5: 
Like a seal of carnelian in a setting of gold:
    a concert of music at a banquet of wine.

    6: 
A seal of emerald in a work of gold:
    the melody of music with delicious wine.

    7: 
Speak, young man, only when necessary,
    when they have asked you more than once.

    8: 
Be brief, say much in few words;
    be knowledgeable and yet quiet.

    9: When among elders do not be forward,
    and with officials do not be too insistent.

    10: 
The lightning that flashes before a hailstorm:
    the esteem that shines on modesty.

    11: 
Leave in good time and do not be the last;
    go home quickly without delay.

    12: 
There enjoy doing as you wish,
    but do not sin through words of pride.

    13: 
Above all, bless your Maker,
    who showers his favors upon you.
The Providence of God

    14: 
Whoever seeks God must accept discipline;
    and whoever resorts to him obtains an answer.

    15: 
Whoever seeks the law will master it,
    but the hypocrite will be ensnared by it.

    16: 
Whoever fears the Lord will understand what is right,
    and out of obscurity he will draw forth a course of action.

    17: 
The lawless turn aside warnings
    and distort the law to suit their purpose.

    18: 
The sensible will not neglect direction;
    the proud and insolent are deterred by no fear.

    19: 
Do nothing without deliberation;
    then once you have acted, have no regrets.

    20: 
Do not go on a way set with snares,
    and do not stumble on the same thing twice.

    21: 
Do not trust the road, because of bandits;

    22: 
    be careful on your paths.

    23: 
Whatever you do, be on your guard,
    for whoever does so keeps the commandments.

    24: 
Whoever keeps the law preserves himself;
    and whoever trusts in the Lord shall not be put to shame.
