Day 134:

Reading Job, chapters ['9', '10', '11', '12']:

  Chapter 9.

    1: Then Job answered and said:

    2: 
I know well that it is so;
    but how can anyone be in the right before God?

    3: 
Should one wish to contend with him,
    he could not answer him once in a thousand times.

    4: 
God is wise in heart and mighty in strength;
    who has withstood him and remained whole?

    5: 
He removes the mountains before they know it;
    he overturns them in his anger.

    6: 
He shakes the earth out of its place,
    and the pillars beneath it tremble.

    7: 
He commands the sun, and it does not rise;
    he seals up the stars.

    8: 
    9: ob’s Second Reply. 1 Then Job answered and said:
2 
I know well that it is so;
    but how can anyone be in the right before God?
3 
Should one wish to contend with him,
    he could not answer him once in a thousand times.
4 
God is wise in heart and mighty in strength;
    who has withstood him and remained whole?
5 
He removes the mountains before they know it;
    he overturns them in his anger.
6 
He shakes the earth out of its place,
    and the pillars beneath it tremble.
7 
He commands the sun, and it does not rise;
    he seals up the stars.
8 
He alone stretches out the heavens
    and treads upon the back of the sea.
9 
He made the Bear and Orion,
    the Pleiades and the constellations of the south;

    10: 
He does things great and unsearchable,
    things marvelous and innumerable.

    11: 
Should he come near me, I do not see him;
    should he pass by, I am not aware of him;

    12: 
Should he seize me forcibly, who can resist?
    Who can say to him, “What are you doing?”

    13: 
He is God and he does not relent;
    the helpers of Rahab bow beneath him.

    14: 
How then could I give him any answer,
    or choose out arguments against him!

    15: 
Even though I were right, I could not answer,
    but should rather beg for what was due me.

    16: 
If I appealed to him and he answered me,
    I could not believe that he would listen to me;

    17: 
With a storm he might overwhelm me,
    and multiply my wounds for nothing;

    18: 
He would not allow me to draw breath,
    but might fill me with bitter griefs.

    19: 
If it be a question of strength, he is mighty;
    or of judgment, who will call him to account?

    20: 
Though I were right, my own mouth might condemn me;
    were I innocent, it might put me in the wrong.

    21: 
I am innocent, but I cannot know it;
    I despise my life.

    22: 
It is all one! therefore I say:
    Both the innocent and the wicked he destroys.

    23: 
When the scourge slays suddenly,
    he scoffs at the despair of the innocent.

    24: 
The earth is given into the hands of the wicked;
    he covers the faces of its judges.
    If it is not he, who then is it?

    25: 
My days are swifter than a runner,
    they flee away; they see no happiness;

    26: 
They shoot by like skiffs of reed,
    like an eagle swooping upon its prey.

    27: 
If I say: I will forget my complaining,
    I will lay aside my sadness and be of good cheer,

    28: 
Then I am in dread of all my pains;
    I know that you will not hold me innocent.

    29: 
It is I who will be accounted guilty;
    why then should I strive in vain?

    30: 
If I should wash myself with soap
    and cleanse my hands with lye,

    31: 
Yet you would plunge me in the ditch,
    so that my garments would abhor me.

    32: 
For he is not a man like myself, that I should answer him,
    that we should come together in judgment.

    33: 
Would that there were an arbiter between us,
    who could lay his hand upon us both

    34: 
    and withdraw his rod from me,
So that his terrors did not frighten me;

    35: 
    that I might speak without being afraid of him.
Since this is not the case with me,
1 
    I loathe my life.


  Chapter 10.

    1: 
I will give myself up to complaint;
    I will speak from the bitterness of my soul.

    2: 
I will say to God: Do not put me in the wrong!
    Let me know why you oppose me.

    3: 
Is it a pleasure for you to oppress,
    to spurn the work of your hands,
    and shine on the plan of the wicked?

    4: 
Have you eyes of flesh?
    Do you see as mortals see?

    5: 
Are your days like the days of a mortal,
    and are your years like a human lifetime,

    6: 
That you seek for guilt in me
    and search after my sins,

    7: 
Even though you know that I am not wicked,
    and that none can deliver me out of your hand?

    8: 
Your hands have formed me and fashioned me;
    will you then turn and destroy me?

    9: 
    10: I will give myself up to complaint;
    I will speak from the bitterness of my soul.
2 
I will say to God: Do not put me in the wrong!
    Let me know why you oppose me.
3 
Is it a pleasure for you to oppress,
    to spurn the work of your hands,
    and shine on the plan of the wicked?
4 
Have you eyes of flesh?
    Do you see as mortals see?
5 
Are your days like the days of a mortal,
    and are your years like a human lifetime,
6 
That you seek for guilt in me
    and search after my sins,
7 
Even though you know that I am not wicked,
    and that none can deliver me out of your hand?
8 
Your hands have formed me and fashioned me;
    will you then turn and destroy me?
9 
Oh, remember that you fashioned me from clay!
    Will you then bring me down to dust again?
10 
Did you not pour me out like milk,
    and thicken me like cheese?

    11: 
With skin and flesh you clothed me,
    with bones and sinews knit me together.

    12: 
Life and love you granted me,
    and your providence has preserved my spirit.

    13: 
Yet these things you have hidden in your heart;
    I know they are your purpose:

    14: 
If I should sin, you would keep a watch on me,
    and from my guilt you would not absolve me.

    15: 
If I should be wicked, alas for me!
    even if righteous, I dare not hold up my head,
    sated with shame, drenched in affliction!

    16: 
Should it lift up, you hunt me like a lion:
    repeatedly you show your wondrous power against me,

    17: 
You renew your attack upon me
    and multiply your harassment of me;
    in waves your troops come against me.

    18: 
Why then did you bring me forth from the womb?
    I should have died and no eye have seen me.

    19: 
I should be as though I had never lived;
    I should have been taken from the womb to the grave.

    20: 
Are not my days few? Stop!
    Let me alone, that I may recover a little

    21: 
Before I go whence I shall not return,
    to the land of darkness and of gloom,

    22: 
The dark, disordered land
    where darkness is the only light.


  Chapter 11.

    1: 
Zophar’s First Speech. 1 And Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:

    2: 
Should not many words be answered,
    or must the garrulous man necessarily be right?

    3: 
Shall your babblings keep others silent,
    and shall you deride and no one give rebuke?

    4: 
Shall you say: “My teaching is pure,
    and I am clean in your sight”?

    5: 
But oh, that God would speak,
    and open his lips against you,

    6: 
And tell you the secrets of wisdom,
    for good sense has two sides;
So you might learn that God
    overlooks some of your sinfulness.

    7: 
Can you find out the depths of God?
    or find out the perfection of the Almighty?

    8: 
It is higher than the heavens; what can you do?
    It is deeper than Sheol; what can you know?

    9: It is longer than the earth in measure,
    and broader than the sea.

    10: 
    11: Zophar’s First Speech. 1 And Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:

9 
It is longer than the earth in measure,
    and broader than the sea.
10 
If he should seize and imprison
    or call to judgment, who then could turn him back?
11 
For he knows the worthless
    and sees iniquity; will he then ignore it?

    12: 
An empty head will gain understanding,
    when a colt of a wild jackass is born human.

    13: 
If you set your heart aright
    and stretch out your hands toward him,

    14: 
If iniquity is in your hand, remove it,
    and do not let injustice dwell in your tent,

    15: 
Surely then you may lift up your face in innocence;
    you may stand firm and unafraid.

    16: 
For then you shall forget your misery,
    like water that has ebbed away you shall regard it.

    17: 
Then your life shall be brighter than the noonday;
    its gloom shall become like the morning,

    18: 
And you shall be secure, because there is hope;
    you shall look round you and lie down in safety;

    19: 
    you shall lie down and no one will disturb you.
Many shall entreat your favor,

    20: 
    but the wicked, looking on, shall be consumed with envy.
Escape shall be cut off from them,
    their only hope their last breath.


  Chapter 12.

    1: 
    2: Job’s Third Reply. 1 Then Job answered and said:
2 
No doubt you are the people
    with whom wisdom shall die!

    3: 
But I have intelligence as well as you;
    I do not fall short of you;
    for who does not know such things as these?

    4: 
I have become the sport of my neighbors:
    “The one whom God answers when he calls upon him,
    The just, the perfect man,” is a laughingstock;

    5: 
The undisturbed esteem my downfall a disgrace
    such as awaits unsteady feet;

    6: 
Yet the tents of robbers are prosperous,
    and those who provoke God are secure,
    whom God has in his power.

    7: 
But now ask the beasts to teach you,
    the birds of the air to tell you;

    8: 
Or speak to the earth to instruct you,
    and the fish of the sea to inform you.

    9: Which of all these does not know
    that the hand of God has done this?

    10: 
In his hand is the soul of every living thing,
    and the life breath of all mortal flesh.

    11:

3 
But I have intelligence as well as you;
    I do not fall short of you;
    for who does not know such things as these?
4

    “The one whom God answers when he calls upon him,
    The just, the perfect man,” is a laughingstock;
5 
The undisturbed esteem my downfall a disgrace
    such as awaits unsteady feet;
6 
Yet the tents of robbers are prosperous,
    and those who provoke God are secure,
    whom God has in his power.[c]
7 
But now ask the beasts to teach you,
    the birds of the air to tell you;
8 
Or speak to the earth to instruct you,
    and the fish of the sea to inform you.
9 
Which of all these does not know
    that the hand of God has done this?
10 
In his hand is the soul of every living thing,
    and the life breath of all mortal flesh.
11 
Does not the ear judge words
    as the mouth tastes food?
12 
So with old age is wisdom,
    and with length of days understanding.

    13: 
With him are wisdom and might;
    his are counsel and understanding.

    14: 
If he knocks a thing down, there is no rebuilding;
    if he imprisons, there is no release.

    15: 
He holds back the waters and there is drought;
    he sends them forth and they overwhelm the land.

    16: 
With him are strength and prudence;
    the misled and the misleaders are his.

    17: 
He sends counselors away barefoot,
    makes fools of judges.

    18: 
He loosens the belt of kings,
    ties a waistcloth on their loins.

    19: 
He sends priests away barefoot,
    leads the powerful astray.

    20: 
He silences the trusted adviser,
    takes discretion from the elders.

    21: 
He pours shame on nobles,
    the waistband of the strong he loosens.

    22: 
He uncovers deep things from the darkness,
    brings the gloom into the light.

    23: 
He makes nations great and destroys them,
    spreads peoples abroad and abandons them.

    24: 
He takes understanding from the leaders of the land,
    makes them wander in a pathless desert.

    25: 
They grope in the darkness without light;
    he makes them wander like drunkards.
