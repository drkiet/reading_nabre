Reading Proverbs, chapters ['17', '18', '19', '20']:

  Chapter 17.

    1: 
1 
Better a dry crust with quiet
    than a house full of feasting with strife.

    2: 
A wise servant will rule over an unworthy son,
    and will share the inheritance of the children.

    3: 
The crucible for silver, and the furnace for gold,
    but the tester of hearts is the Lord.

    4: 
The evildoer gives heed to wicked lips,
    the liar, to a mischievous tongue.

    5: 
Whoever mocks the poor reviles their Maker;
    whoever rejoices in their misfortune will not go unpunished.

    6: 
    7: 1 
Better a dry crust with quiet
    than a house full of feasting with strife.

The crucible for silver, and the furnace for gold,
    but the tester of hearts is the Lord.
4 
The evildoer gives heed to wicked lips,
    the liar, to a mischievous tongue.
5 
Whoever mocks the poor reviles their Maker;
    whoever rejoices in their misfortune will not go unpunished.
6 
Children’s children are the crown of the elderly,
    and the glory of children is their parentage.
7 
Fine words ill fit a fool;
    how much more lying lips, a noble!

    8: 
A bribe seems a charm to its user;
    at every turn it brings success.

    9: Whoever overlooks an offense fosters friendship,
    but whoever gossips about it separates friends.

    10: 
A single reprimand does more for a discerning person
    than a hundred lashes for a fool.

    11: 
The wicked pursue only rebellion,
    and a merciless messenger is sent against them.

    12: 
Face a bear robbed of her cubs,
    but never fools in their folly!

    13: 
If you return evil for good,
    evil will not depart from your house.

    14: 
The start of strife is like the opening of a dam;
    check a quarrel before it bursts forth!

    15: 
Whoever acquits the wicked, whoever condemns the just—
    both are an abomination to the Lord.

    16: 
    17: 1 
Better a dry crust with quiet
    than a house full of feasting with strife.
2

    and will share the inheritance of the children.[b]

    and the glory of children is their parentage.
7

14 
The start of strife is like the opening of a dam;
    check a quarrel before it bursts forth!
15 
Whoever acquits the wicked, whoever condemns the just—
    both are an abomination to the Lord.
16 
Of what use is money in the hands of fools
    when they have no heart to acquire wisdom?[i]
17 
A friend is a friend at all times,
    and a brother is born for the time of adversity.

    18: 
Those without sense give their hands in pledge,
    becoming surety for their neighbors.

    19: 
Those who love an offense love a fight;
    those who build their gate high court disaster.

    20: 
The perverse in heart come to no good,
    and the double-tongued fall into trouble.

    21: 
Whoever conceives a fool has grief;
    the father of a numskull has no joy.

    22: 
A joyful heart is the health of the body,
    but a depressed spirit dries up the bones.

    23: 
A guilty person takes out a bribe from the pocket,
    thus perverting the course of justice.

    24: 
On the countenance of a discerning person is wisdom,
    but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.

    25: 
A foolish son is vexation to his father,
    and bitter sorrow to her who bore him.

    26: 
It is wrong to fine an innocent person,
    but beyond reason to scourge nobles.

    27: 
Those who spare their words are truly knowledgeable,
    and those who are discreet are intelligent.

    28: 
Even fools, keeping silent, are considered wise;
    if they keep their lips closed, intelligent.

The words of a talebearer are like dainty morsels:
    they sink into one’s inmost being.

    9: Those slack in their work
    are kin to the destroyer.

    10: 
The name of the Lord is a strong tower;
    the just run to it and are safe.

    11: 
The wealth of the rich is their strong city;
    they fancy it a high wall.

    12: 
Before disaster the heart is haughty,
    but before honor is humility.

    13: 
Whoever answers before listening,
    theirs is folly and shame.

    14: 
One’s spirit supports one when ill,
    but a broken spirit who can bear?

Gifts clear the way for people,
    winning access to the great.
17 
Those who plead the case first seem to be in the right;
    then the opponent comes and cross-examines them.[h]
18 
The lot puts an end to disputes,
    and decides a controversy between the mighty.[i]

    19: 
A brother offended is more unyielding than a stronghold;
    such strife is more daunting than castle gates.

    20: 
With the fruit of one’s mouth one’s belly is filled,
    with the produce of one’s lips one is sated.

    21: 
Death and life are in the power of the tongue;
    those who choose one shall eat its fruit.

    22: 
To find a wife is to find happiness,
    a favor granted by the Lord.

    23: 
The poor implore,
    but the rich answer harshly.

    24: 
There are friends who bring ruin,
    but there are true friends more loyal than a brother.

    2: 
1 
Wine is arrogant, strong drink is riotous;

    12: 
The ear that hears, the eye that sees—
    the Lord has made them both.

    13:

    then goes away only to boast.

    15: 
One can put on gold and abundant jewels,
    but wise lips are the most precious ornament.

Plans made with advice succeed;

Those who curse father or mother—
    their lamp will go out[k] in the dead of night.

    21: 
Possessions greedily guarded at the outset
    will not be blessed in the end.

    22: 
Do not say, “I will repay evil!”
    Wait for the Lord, who will help you.

    23: 
Varying weights are an abomination to the Lord,
    and false scales are not good.

    24: 
Our steps are from the Lord;
    how, then, can mortals understand their way?

    25: 
It is a trap to pledge rashly a sacred gift,
    and after a vow, then to reflect.

    26: 
A wise king winnows the wicked,
    and threshes them under the cartwheel.

    27: 
A lamp from the Lord is human life-breath;
    it searches through the inmost being.

    28: 
His steadfast loyalty safeguards the king,
    and he upholds his throne by justice.

    29: 
The glory of the young is their strength,
    and the dignity of the old is gray hair.

    30: 
Evil is cleansed away by bloody lashes,
    and a scourging to the inmost being.
