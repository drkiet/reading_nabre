Day 274:

Reading Nahum, chapters ['1', '2', '3']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: 1 Oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.
God’s Terrifying Appearance

    2: 
A jealous and avenging God[c] is the Lord,
    an avenger is the Lord, full of wrath;
The Lord takes vengeance on his adversaries,
    and rages against his enemies;

    3: 
The Lord is slow to anger, yet great in power;
    the Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished.
In stormwind and tempest he comes,
    and clouds are the dust at his feet;

    4: 
He roars at the sea and leaves it dry,
    and all the rivers he dries up.
Laid low are Bashan and Carmel,
    and the bloom of Lebanon withers;

    5: 
The mountains quake before him,
    and the hills dissolve;
The earth is laid waste before him,
    the world and all who dwell in it.

    6: 
Before his wrath, who can stand firm,
    and who can face his blazing anger?
His fury is poured out like fire,
    and boulders break apart before him.

    7: 
The Lord is good to those who wait for him,
    a refuge on the day of distress,
Taking care of those who look to him for protection,

    8: 
    when the flood rages;
He makes an end of his opponents,
    and pursues his enemies into darkness.
Nineveh’s Judgment and Judah’s Restoration

    9: What do you plot against the Lord,
    the one about to bring total destruction?
    No opponent rises a second time!

    10: 
Like a thorny thicket, they are tangled,
    and like drunkards, they are drunk;
    like dry stubble, they are utterly consumed.

    11: 
From you has come
    one plotting evil against the Lord,
    one giving sinister counsel.

    12: 
Thus says the Lord:
    though fully intact and so numerous,
    they shall be mown down and disappear.
Though I have humbled you,
    I will humble you no more.

    13: 
Now I will break his yoke off of you,
    and tear off your bonds.

    14: 
The Lord has commanded regarding you:
    no descendant will again bear your name;
From the house of your gods I will abolish
    the carved and the molten image;
    I will make your grave a dung heap.


  Chapter 2.

    1: 
    2: 1 
At this moment on the mountains
    the footsteps of one bearing good news,
    of one announcing peace!
Celebrate your feasts, Judah,
    fulfill your vows!
For never again will destroyers invade you;
    they are completely cut off.
The Attack on Nineveh
2 
One who scatters has come up against you;[b]
    guard the rampart,
Watch the road, brace yourselves,
    marshal all your strength!

    3: 
The Lord will restore the vine of Jacob,
    the honor of Israel,
Because ravagers have ravaged them
    and ruined their branches.

    4: 
The shields of his warriors are crimsoned,
    the soldiers clad in scarlet;
Like fire are the trappings of the chariots
    on the day he prepares for war;
    the cavalry is agitated!

    5: 
The chariots dash madly through the streets
    and wheel in the squares,
Looking like torches,
    bolting like lightning.

    6: 
His picked troops are called,
    ranks break at their charge;
To the wall they rush,
    their screen is set up.

    7: 
The river gates are opened,
    the palace is washed away.

    8: 
The mistress is led forth captive,
    and her maidservants led away,
Moaning like doves,
    beating their breasts.

    9: Nineveh is like a pool
    whose waters escape;
“Stop! Stop!”
    but none turns back.

    10: 
“Plunder the silver, plunder the gold!”
    There is no end to the treasure,
    to wealth in every precious thing!

    11: 
Emptiness, desolation, waste;
    melting hearts and trembling knees,
Churning in every stomach,
    every face turning pale!

    12: 
Where is the lionesses’ den,
    the young lions’ cave,
Where the lion went in and out,
    and the cub, with no one to disturb them?

    13: 
The lion tore apart enough for his cubs,
    and strangled for his lionesses;
He filled his lairs with prey,
    and his dens with torn flesh.

    14: 
I now come against you—
    oracle of the Lord of hosts—
I will consume your chariots in smoke,
    and the sword will devour your young lions;
Your preying on the land I will bring to an end,
    the cry of your lionesses will be heard no more.


  Chapter 3.

    1: 
Ah! The bloody city,
    all lies,
Full of plunder,
    whose looting never stops!

    2: 
    3: 1 
Ah! The bloody city,
    all lies,
Full of plunder,
    whose looting never stops!
2 
The crack of the whip,
    the rumbling of wheels;
Horses galloping,
    chariots bounding,
3 
Cavalry charging,
    the flash of the sword,
    the gleam of the spear;
A multitude of slain,
    a mass of corpses,
Endless bodies
    to stumble upon!

    4: 
For the many debaucheries of the prostitute,
    a charming mistress of witchcraft,
Who enslaved nations with her prostitution,
    and peoples by her witchcraft:

    5: 
I now come against you—
    oracle of the Lord of hosts—
    and I will lift your skirt above your face;
I will show your nakedness to the nations,
    to the kingdoms your shame!

    6: 
I will cast filth upon you,
    disgrace you and make you a spectacle;

    7: 
Until everyone who sees you
    runs from you saying,
“Nineveh is destroyed;
    who can pity her?
Where can I find
    any to console you?”
Nineveh’s Inescapable Fate

    8: 
Are you better than No-amon
    that was set among the Nile’s canals,
Surrounded by waters,
    with the river for her rampart
    and water for her wall?

    9: Ethiopia was her strength,
    and Egypt without end;
Put and the Libyans
    were her allies.

    10: 
Yet even she became an exile,
    and went into captivity;
Even her little ones were dashed to pieces
    at the corner of every street;
For her nobles they cast lots,
    and all her great ones were put into chains.

    11: 
You, too, will drink of this;
    you will be overcome;
You, too, will seek
    a refuge from the foe.

    12: 
But all your fortresses are fig trees,
    bearing early figs;
When shaken, they fall
    into the devourer’s mouth.

    13: 
Indeed your troops
    are women in your midst;
To your foes are open wide
    the gates of your land,
    fire has consumed their bars.

    14: 
Draw water for the siege,
    strengthen your fortresses;
Go down into the mud
    and tread the clay,
    take hold of the brick mold!

    15: 
There the fire will consume you,
    the sword will cut you down;
    it will consume you like the grasshoppers.
Multiply like the grasshoppers,
    multiply like the locusts!

    16: 
You have made your traders more numerous
    than the stars of the heavens;
    like grasshoppers that shed their skins and fly away.

    17: 
Your sentries are like locusts,
    and your scribes like locust swarms
Gathered on the rubble fences
    on a cold day!
Yet when the sun rises, they vanish,
    and no one knows where they have gone.

    18: 
Your shepherds slumber,
    O king of Assyria,
    your nobles have gone to rest;
Your people are scattered upon the mountains,
    with none to gather them.

    19: 
There is no healing for your hurt,
    your wound is fatal.
All who hear this news of you
    clap their hands over you;
For who has not suffered
    under your endless malice?
