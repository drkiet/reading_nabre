Day 138:

Reading Job, chapters ['25', '26', '27', '28']:

  Chapter 25.

    1: 
    2: 
Bildad’s Third Speech. 1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
2 
Dominion and dread are his
    who brings about harmony in his heavens.

    3: 
Is there any numbering of his troops?
    Yet on which of them does his light not rise?

    4: 
    5: Bildad’s Third Speech. 1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
2 
Dominion and dread are his
    who brings about harmony in his heavens.
3 
Is there any numbering of his troops?[b]
    Yet on which of them does his light not rise?
4 
How can anyone be in the right against God,
    or how can any born of woman be innocent?
5 
Even the moon is not bright
    and the stars are not clean in his eyes.

    6: 
How much less a human being, who is but a worm,
    a mortal, who is only a maggot?


  Chapter 26.

    1: 
    2: 
Job’s Reply. 1 Then Job answered and said:
2 
What help you give to the powerless,
    what strength to the feeble arm!

    3: 
How you give counsel to one without wisdom;
    how profuse is the advice you offer!

    4: 
With whose help have you uttered those words,
    whose breath comes forth from you?

    5: 
    6: Job’s Reply. 1 Then Job answered and said:
2 
What help you give to the powerless,
    what strength to the feeble arm!
3 
How you give counsel to one without wisdom;
    how profuse is the advice you offer!
4 
With whose help have you uttered those words,
    whose breath comes forth from you?
5 
The shades[b] beneath writhe in terror,
    the waters, and their inhabitants.
6 
Naked before him is Sheol,[c]
    and Abaddon has no covering.

    7: 
He stretches out Zaphon over the void,
    and suspends the earth over nothing at all;

    8: 
He binds up the waters in his clouds,
    yet the cloud is not split by their weight;

    9: He holds back the appearance of the full moon
    by spreading his clouds before it.

    10: 
He has marked out a circle on the surface of the deep
    as the boundary of light and darkness.

    11: 
The pillars of the heavens tremble
    and are stunned at his thunderous rebuke;

    12: 
By his power he stilled Sea,
    by his skill he crushed Rahab;

    13: 
By his wind the heavens were made clear,
    his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.

    14: 
Lo, these are but the outlines of his ways,
    and what a whisper of a word we hear of him:
    Who can comprehend the thunder of his power?


  Chapter 27.

    1: 
    2: 
Job’s Reply. 1 Job took up his theme again and said:
2 
As God lives, who takes away my right,
    the Almighty, who has made my life bitter,

    3: 
So long as I still have life breath in me,
    the breath of God in my nostrils,

    4: 
My lips shall not speak falsehood,
    nor my tongue utter deceit!

    5: 
Far be it from me to account you right;
    till I die I will not renounce my innocence.

    6: 
    7: Job’s Reply. 1 Job took up his theme again and said:
2 
As God lives, who takes away my right,
    the Almighty, who has made my life bitter,
3 
So long as I still have life breath in me,
    the breath of God in my nostrils,
4 
My lips shall not speak falsehood,
    nor my tongue utter deceit!
5 
Far be it from me to account you right;
    till I die I will not renounce my innocence.
6 
My justice I maintain and I will not relinquish it;
    my heart does not reproach me for any of my days.
7 
[b]Let my enemy be as the wicked
    and my adversary as the unjust!

    8: 
For what hope has the impious when he is cut off,
    when God requires his life?

    9: Will God then listen to his cry
    when distress comes upon him,

    10: 
If he delights in the Almighty
    and calls upon God constantly?

    11: 
I will teach you what is in God’s hand,
    and the way of the Almighty I will not conceal.

    12: 
Look, you yourselves have all seen it;
    why do you spend yourselves in empty words!

    13: 
This is the portion of the wicked with God,
    the heritage oppressors receive from the Almighty:

    14: 
Though his children be many, the sword awaits them.
    His descendants shall want for bread.

    15: 
His survivors shall be buried in death;
    their widows shall not weep.

    16: 
Though he heap up silver like dust
    and store away mounds of clothing,

    17: 
What he has stored the righteous shall wear,
    and the innocent shall divide the silver.

    18: 
He builds his house as of cobwebs,
    or like a booth put up by a watchman.

    19: 
He lies down a rich man, one last time;
    he opens his eyes—nothing is there.

    20: 
Terrors flood over him like water,
    at night the tempest carries him off.

    21: 
The east wind seizes him and he is gone;
    it sweeps him from his place;

    22: 
It hurls itself at him without pity,
    as he tries to flee from its power.

    23: 
It claps its hands at him,
    and whistles at him from its place.


  Chapter 28.

    1: 
    2: 
Where Is Wisdom to Be Found?
1 
There is indeed a mine for silver,
    and a place for refining gold.
2 
Iron is taken from the earth,
    and copper smelted out of stone.

    3: 
He sets a boundary for the darkness;
    the farthest confines he explores.

    4: 
He breaks open a shaft far from habitation,
    unknown to human feet;
    suspended, far from people, they sway.

    5: 
The earth, though out of it comes forth bread,
    is in fiery upheaval underneath.

    6: 
Its stones are the source of lapis lazuli,
    and there is gold in its dust.

    7: 
    8: Where Is Wisdom to Be Found?
1 
There is indeed a mine for silver,
    and a place for refining gold.
2 
Iron is taken from the earth,
    and copper smelted out of stone.
3 
[b]He sets a boundary for the darkness;
    the farthest confines he explores.
4 
He breaks open a shaft far from habitation,
    unknown to human feet;
    suspended, far from people, they sway.
5 
The earth, though out of it comes forth bread,
    is in fiery upheaval underneath.
6 
Its stones are the source of lapis lazuli,
    and there is gold in its dust.
7 
The path no bird of prey knows,
    nor has the hawk’s eye seen it.
8 
The proud beasts have not trodden it,
    nor has the lion gone that way.

    9: He sets his hand to the flinty rock,
    and overturns the mountains at their root.

    10: 
He splits channels in the rocks;
    his eyes behold all that is precious.

    11: 
He dams up the sources of the streams,
    and brings hidden things to light.

    12: 
As for wisdom—where can she be found?
    Where is the place of understanding?

    13: 
Mortals do not know her path,
    nor is she to be found in the land of the living.

    14: 
The Deep says, “She is not in me”;
    and the Sea says, “She is not with me.”

    15: 
Solid gold cannot purchase her,
    nor can her price be paid with silver.

    16: 
She cannot be bought with gold of Ophir,
    with precious onyx or lapis lazuli,

    17: 
Gold or crystal cannot equal her,
    nor can golden vessels be exchanged for her.

    18: 
Neither coral nor crystal should be thought of;
    the value of wisdom surpasses pearls.

    19: 
Ethiopian topaz does not equal her,
    nor can she be weighed out for pure gold.

    20: 
As for wisdom, where does she come from?
    Where is the place of understanding?

    21: 
She is hidden from the eyes of every living thing;
    even from the birds of the air she is concealed.

    22: 
Abaddon and Death say,
    “Only by rumor have we heard of her.”

    23: 
But God understands the way to her;
    it is he who knows her place.

    24: 
For he beholds the ends of the earth
    and sees all that is under the heavens.

    25: 
When he weighed out the wind,
    and measured out the waters;

    26: 
When he made a rule for the rain
    and a path for the thunderbolts,

    27: 
    28: Where Is Wisdom to Be Found?
1

    and a place for refining gold.

18

    the value of wisdom surpasses pearls.
19

    nor can she be weighed out for pure gold.
20

    Where is the place of understanding?
21 
She is hidden from the eyes of every living thing;
    even from the birds of the air she is concealed.
22 
Abaddon[d] and Death say,
    “Only by rumor have we heard of her.”
23 
[e]But God understands the way to her;
    it is he who knows her place.
24 
For he beholds the ends of the earth
    and sees all that is under the heavens.
25 
When he weighed out the wind,
    and measured out the waters;
26 
When he made a rule for the rain
    and a path for the thunderbolts,
27 
Then he saw wisdom and appraised her,
    established her, and searched her out.
28 
[f]And to mortals he said:
    See: the fear of the Lord is wisdom;
    and avoiding evil is understanding.
