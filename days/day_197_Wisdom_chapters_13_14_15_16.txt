Reading Wisdom, chapters ['13', '14', '15', '16']:

  Chapter 13.

    1: 
Digression on False Worship
A. Nature Worship
1 
Foolish by nature were all who were in ignorance of God,
    and who from the good things seen did not succeed in knowing the one who is,[b]
    and from studying the works did not discern the artisan;

A. Nature Worship
1 
Foolish by nature were all who were in ignorance of God,
    and who from the good things seen did not succeed in knowing the one who is,[b]
    and from studying the works did not discern the artisan;
2 
Instead either fire, or wind, or the swift air,
    or the circuit of the stars, or the mighty water,
    or the luminaries of heaven, the governors[c] of the world, they considered gods.
3 
Now if out of joy in their beauty they thought them gods,
    let them know how far more excellent is the Lord than these;
    for the original source of beauty fashioned them.

    4: 
Or if they were struck by their might and energy,
    let them realize from these things how much more powerful is the one who made them.

    5: 
For from the greatness and the beauty of created things
    their original author, by analogy, is seen.

    6: 
But yet, for these the blame is less;
For they have gone astray perhaps,
    though they seek God and wish to find him.

    7: 
For they search busily among his works,
    but are distracted by what they see, because the things seen are fair.

    8: 
But again, not even these are pardonable.

    9: For if they so far succeeded in knowledge
    that they could speculate about the world,
    how did they not more quickly find its Lord?
B. Idolatry

    10: 
But wretched are they, and in dead things are their hopes,
    who termed gods things made by human hands:
Gold and silver, the product of art, and images of beasts,
    or useless stone, the work of an ancient hand.
The Carpenter and Wooden Idols

    11: 
A carpenter may cut down a suitable tree
    and skillfully scrape off all its bark,
And deftly plying his art
    produce something fit for daily use,

    who termed gods things made by human hands:

The Carpenter and Wooden Idols
11 
A carpenter may cut down a suitable tree
    and skillfully scrape off all its bark,
And deftly plying his art
    produce something fit for daily use,
12 
And use the scraps from his handiwork
    in preparing his food, and have his fill;
13 
Then the good-for-nothing refuse from these remnants,
    crooked wood grown full of knots,
    he takes and carves to occupy his spare time.
This wood he models with mindless skill,
    and patterns it on the image of a human being

    14: 
    or makes it resemble some worthless beast.
When he has daubed it with red and crimsoned its surface with red stain,
    and daubed over every blemish in it,

    15: 
He makes a fitting shrine for it
    and puts it on the wall, fastening it with a nail.

    16: 
Thus he provides for it lest it fall down,
    knowing that it cannot help itself;
    for, truly, it is an image and needs help.

    17: 
But when he prays about his goods or marriage or children,
    he is not ashamed to address the thing without a soul.
For vigor he invokes the powerless;

    18: 
    for life he entreats the dead;
For aid he beseeches the wholly incompetent;
    for travel, something that cannot even walk;

    19: 
For profit in business and success with his hands
    he asks power of a thing with hands utterly powerless.


  Chapter 14.

    1: 
1 
Again, one preparing for a voyage and about to traverse the wild waves
    cries out to wood more unsound than the boat that bears him.

    2: 
For the urge for profits devised this latter,
    and Wisdom the artisan produced it.

    3: 
    4: 1 
Again, one preparing for a voyage and about to traverse the wild waves
    cries out to wood more unsound than the boat that bears him.
2 
For the urge for profits devised this latter,
    and Wisdom the artisan produced it.
3 
But your providence, O Father! guides it,
    for you have furnished even in the sea a road,
    and through the waves a steady path,
4 
Showing that you can save from any danger,
    so that even one without skill may embark.

    5: 
But you will that the products of your Wisdom be not idle;
    therefore people trust their lives even to most frail wood,
    and were safe crossing the waves on a raft.

    6: 
For of old, when the proud giants were being destroyed,
    the hope of the universe, who took refuge on a raft,
    left to the world a future for the human family, under the guidance of your hand.

    7: 
For blest is the wood through which righteousness comes about;

    8: 
    but the handmade idol is accursed, and its maker as well:
    he for having produced it, and the corruptible thing, because it was termed a god.

    9: Equally odious to God are the evildoer and the evil deed;

    10: 
    and the thing made will be punished with its maker.

    11: 
Therefore upon even the idols of the nations shall a judgment come,
    since they became abominable among God’s works,
Snares for human souls
    and a trap for the feet of the senseless.
The Origin and Evils of Idolatry

    12: 
For the source of wantonness is the devising of idols;
    and their invention, a corruption of life.

    13:

The Origin and Evils of Idolatry
12 
For the source of wantonness is the devising of idols;
    and their invention, a corruption of life.
13 
For in the beginning they were not,
    nor can they ever continue;
14 
    for from human emptiness they came into the world,
    and therefore a sudden end is devised for them.

    15: 
For a father, afflicted with untimely mourning,
    made an image of the child so quickly taken from him,
And now honored as a god what once was dead
    and handed down to his household mysteries and sacrifices.

    16: 
Then, in the course of time, the impious practice gained strength and was observed as law,
    and graven things were worshiped by royal decrees.

    17: 
People who lived so far away that they could not honor him in his presence
    copied the appearance of the distant king
And made a public image of him they wished to honor,
    out of zeal to flatter the absent one as though present.

    18: 
And to promote this observance among those to whom it was strange,
    the artisan’s ambition provided a stimulus.

    19: 
For he, perhaps in his determination to please the ruler,
    labored over the likeness to the best of his skill;

    20: 
And the masses, drawn by the charm of the workmanship,
    soon took as an object of worship the one who shortly before was honored as a human being.

    21: 
And this became a snare for the world,
    that people enslaved to either grief or tyranny
    conferred the incommunicable Name on stones and wood.

    22: 
Then it was not enough for them to err in their knowledge of God;
    but even though they live in a great war resulting from ignorance,
    they call such evils peace.

    23: 
For while they practice either child sacrifices or occult mysteries,
    or frenzied carousing in exotic rites,

    24: 
They no longer respect either lives or purity of marriage;
    but they either waylay and kill each other, or aggrieve each other by adultery.

    25: 
And all is confusion—blood and murder, theft and guile,
    corruption, faithlessness, turmoil, perjury,

    26: 
Disturbance of good people, neglect of gratitude,
    besmirching of souls, unnatural lust,
    disorder in marriage, adultery and shamelessness.

    27: 
For the worship of infamous idols
    is the reason and source and extreme of all evil.

    28: 
For they either go mad with enjoyment, or prophesy lies,
    or live lawlessly or lightly perjure themselves.

    29: 
For as their trust is in lifeless idols,
    they expect no harm when they have sworn falsely.

    30: 
But on both counts justice shall overtake them:
    because they thought perversely of God by devoting themselves to idols,
    and because they deliberately swore false oaths, despising piety.

    31: 
For it is not the might of those by whom they swear,
    but the just retribution of sinners,
    that ever follows upon the transgression of the wicked.


  Chapter 15.

    1: 
1 
But you, our God, are good and true,
    slow to anger, and governing all with mercy.

    2: 
For even if we sin, we are yours, and know your might;
    but we will not sin, knowing that we belong to you.

    3: 
For to know you well is complete righteousness,
    and to know your might is the root of immortality.

    4: 
    5: 1 
But you, our God, are good and true,
    slow to anger, and governing all with mercy.
2 
For even if we sin, we are yours, and know your might;
    but we will not sin, knowing that we belong to you.
3 
For to know you well is complete righteousness,
    and to know your might is the root of immortality.
4 
For the evil creation of human fancy did not deceive us,
    nor the fruitless labor of painters,
A form smeared with varied colors,
5 
    the sight of which arouses yearning in a fool,
    till he longs for the inanimate form of a dead image.

    6: 
Lovers of evil things, and worthy of such hopes
    are they who make them and long for them and worship them.
The Potter’s Clay Idols

    7: 
For the potter, laboriously working the soft earth,
    molds for our service each single article:
He fashions out of the same clay
    both the vessels that serve for clean purposes
    and their opposites, all alike;
As to what shall be the use of each vessel of either class
    the worker in clay is the judge.

    8: 
With misspent toil he molds a meaningless god from the selfsame clay,
    though he himself shortly before was made from the earth,
And is soon to go whence he was taken,
    when the life that was lent him is demanded back.

    9: But his concern is not that he is to die
    nor that his span of life is brief;
Rather, he vies with goldsmiths and silversmiths
    and emulates molders of bronze,
    and takes pride in fashioning counterfeits.

    10: 
Ashes his heart is! more worthless than earth is his hope,
    more ignoble than clay his life;

    11: 
Because he knew not the one who fashioned him,
    and breathed into him a quickening soul,
    and infused a vital spirit.

    12: 
Instead, he esteemed our life a mere game,
    and our span of life a holiday for gain;
“For one must,” says he, “make a profit in every way, be it even from evil.”

    13: 
For more than anyone else he knows that he is sinning,
    when out of earthen stuff he creates fragile vessels and idols alike.

    14: 
    15: 1 
But you, our God, are good and true,
    slow to anger, and governing all with mercy.
2 
For even if we sin, we are yours, and know your might;
    but we will not sin, knowing that we belong to you.
3 
For to know you well is complete righteousness,
    and to know your might is the root of immortality.

    till he longs for the inanimate form of a dead image.

    are they who make them and long for them and worship them.

[b]With misspent toil he molds a meaningless god from the selfsame clay,
    though he himself shortly before was made from the earth,
And is soon to go whence he was taken,
    when the life that was lent him is demanded back.
9

    nor that his span of life is brief;
Rather, he vies with goldsmiths and silversmiths

10 
Ashes his heart is![c] more worthless than earth is his hope,
    more ignoble than clay his life;

Because he knew not the one who fashioned him,
    and breathed into him a quickening soul,
    and infused a vital spirit.

13 
For more than anyone else he knows that he is sinning,
    when out of earthen stuff he creates fragile vessels and idols alike.
14 
But most stupid of all and worse than senseless in mind,
    are the enemies of your people who enslaved them.
15 
For they esteemed all the idols of the nations as gods,
    which cannot use their eyes to see,
    nor nostrils to breathe the air,
Nor ears to hear,
    nor fingers on their hands for feeling;
    even their feet are useless to walk with.

    16: 
For it was a mere human being who made them;
    one living on borrowed breath who fashioned them.
For no one is able to fashion a god like himself;

    17: 
    he is mortal, and what he makes with lawless hands is dead.
For he is better than the things he worships;
    he at least lives, but never his idols.
Second Example Resumed

    18: 
Besides, they worship the most loathsome beasts—
    as regards stupidity, these are worse than the rest,[e]

    19: 
For beasts are neither good-looking nor desirable;
    they have escaped both the approval of God and his blessing.


  Chapter 16.

    1: 
1 
Therefore they were fittingly punished by similar creatures,
    and were tormented by a swarm of insects.

    2: 
Instead of this punishment, you benefited your people
    with a novel dish, the delight they craved,
    by providing quail for their food,

    3: 
So that those others, when they desired food,
    should lose their appetite even for necessities,
    since the creatures sent to plague them were so loathsome,
While these, after a brief period of privation,
    partook of a novel dish.

    4: 
For inexorable want had to come upon those oppressors;
    but these needed only to be shown how their enemies were being tormented.

4 
For inexorable want had to come upon those oppressors;
    but these needed only to be shown how their enemies were being tormented.
5 
For when the dire venom of beasts came upon them
    and they were dying from the bite of crooked serpents,
    your anger endured not to the end.
6 
But as a warning, for a short time they were terrorized,
    though they had a sign[b] of salvation, to remind them of the precept of your law.

    7: 
For the one who turned toward it was saved,
    not by what was seen,
    but by you, the savior of all.

    8: 
By this also you convinced our foes
    that you are the one who delivers from all evil.

    9: For the bites of locusts and of flies slew them,
    and no remedy was found to save their lives
    because they deserved to be punished by such means;

    10: 
But not even the fangs of poisonous reptiles overcame your children,
    for your mercy came forth and healed them.

    11: 
For as a reminder of your injunctions, they were stung,
    and swiftly they were saved,
Lest they should fall into deep forgetfulness
    and become unresponsive to your beneficence.

    12: 
For indeed, neither herb nor application cured them,
    but your all-healing word, O Lord!

    13: 
For you have dominion over life and death;
    you lead down to the gates of Hades and lead back.

    14: 
Human beings, however, may kill another with malice,
    but they cannot bring back the departed spirit,
    or release the soul that death has confined.

    or release the soul that death has confined.
15 
Your hand no one can escape.
Third Example: A Rain of Manna for Israel Instead of the Plague of Storms
16 
For the wicked who refused to know you
    were punished by the might of your arm,
Were pursued by unusual rains and hailstorms and unremitting downpours,
    and were consumed by fire.

    17: 
For against all expectation, in water which quenches everything,
    the fire grew more active;
For the universe fights on behalf of the righteous.

    18: 
Then the flame was tempered
    so that the beasts that were sent upon the wicked might not be burnt up,
    but that these might see and know that they were struck by the judgment of God;

    19: 
And again, even in the water, fire blazed beyond its strength
    so as to consume the produce of the wicked land.

    20: 
Instead of this, you nourished your people with food of angels
    and furnished them bread from heaven, ready to hand, untoiled-for,
    endowed with all delights and conforming to every taste.

    21: 
For this substance of yours revealed your sweetness toward your children,
    and serving the desire of the one who received it,
    was changed to whatever flavor each one wished.

    22: 
Yet snow and ice withstood fire and were not melted,
    so that they might know that their enemies’ fruits
Were consumed by a fire that blazed in the hail
    and flashed lightning in the rain.

    23: 
But this fire, again, in order that the righteous might be nourished,
    forgot even its proper strength;

    24: 
For your creation, serving you, its maker,
    grows tense for punishment against the wicked,
    but is relaxed in benefit for those who trust in you.

    25: 
Therefore at that very time, transformed in all sorts of ways,
    it was serving your all-nourishing bounty
    according to what they needed and desired;

    26: 
That your children whom you loved might learn, O Lord,
    that it is not the various kinds of fruits that nourish,
    but your word that preserves those who believe you!

    27: 
For what was not destroyed by fire,
    melted when merely warmed by a momentary sunbeam;

    28: 
To make known that one must give you thanks before sunrise,
    and turn to you at daybreak.

    29: 
For the hope of the ungrateful melts like a wintry frost
    and runs off like useless water.
