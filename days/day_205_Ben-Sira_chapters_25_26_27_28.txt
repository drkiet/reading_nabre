Day 205:

Reading Ben-Sira, chapters ['25', '26', '27', '28']:

  Chapter 25.

    1: 
    2: 
Those Who Are Worthy of Praise
1 
With three things I am delighted,
    for they are pleasing to the Lord and to human beings:
Harmony among relatives, friendship among neighbors,
    and a wife and a husband living happily together.
2 
Three kinds of people I hate,
    and I loathe their manner of life:
A proud pauper, a rich liar,
    and a lecherous old fool.

    3: 
In your youth you did not gather.
    How will you find anything in your old age?

    4: 
    5: Those Who Are Worthy of Praise
1 
With three things I am delighted,
    for they are pleasing to the Lord and to human beings:
Harmony among relatives, friendship among neighbors,
    and a wife and a husband living happily together.
2 
Three kinds of people I hate,
    and I loathe their manner of life:
A proud pauper, a rich liar,
    and a lecherous old fool.
3 
In your youth you did not gather.
    How will you find anything in your old age?
4 
How appropriate is sound judgment in the gray-haired,
    and good counsel in the elderly!
5 
How appropriate is wisdom in the aged,
    understanding and counsel in the venerable!

    6: 
The crown of the elderly, wide experience;
    their glory, the fear of the Lord.

    7: 
There are nine who come to mind as blessed,
    a tenth whom my tongue proclaims:
The man who finds joy in his children,
    and the one who lives to see the downfall of his enemies.

    8: 
Happy the man who lives with a sensible woman,
    and the one who does not plow with an ox and a donkey combined.
Happy the one who does not sin with the tongue,
    who does not serve an inferior.

    9: Happy the one who finds a friend,
    who speaks to attentive ears.

    10: 
How great is the one who finds wisdom,
    but none is greater than the one who fears the Lord.

    11: 
Fear of the Lord surpasses all else.
    To whom can we compare the one who has it?
Wicked and Virtuous Women[e]
13 
Any wound, but not a wound of the heart!
    Any wickedness, but not the wickedness of a woman!
14 
Any suffering, but not suffering from one’s foes!
    Any vengeance, but not the vengeance of one’s enemies!
15 
There is no poison worse than that of a serpent,
    no venom greater than that of a woman.
16 
I would rather live with a dragon or a lion
    than live with a wicked woman.
17 
A woman’s wicked disposition changes her appearance,
    and makes her face as dark as a bear.
18 
When her husband sits among his neighbors,
    a bitter sigh escapes him unawares.
19 
There is hardly an evil like that in a woman;
    may she fall to the lot of the sinner!
20 
Like a sandy hill to aged feet
    is a garrulous wife to a quiet husband.
21 
Do not be enticed by a woman’s beauty,
    or be greedy for her wealth.
22 
Harsh is the slavery and great the shame
    when a wife supports her husband.
23 
Depressed mind, gloomy face,
    and a wounded heart—a wicked woman.
Drooping hands and quaking knees,
    any wife who does not make her husband happy.
24 
With a woman sin had a beginning,
    and because of her we all die.[f]
25 
Allow water no outlet,
    and no boldness of speech to a wicked woman.
26 
If she does not go along as you direct,
    cut her away from you.


  Chapter 26.

    1: 
    2: 
1 
Happy the husband of a good wife;
    the number of his days will be doubled.
2 
A loyal wife brings joy to her husband,
    and he will finish his years in peace.

    3: 
A good wife is a generous gift
    bestowed upon him who fears the Lord.

    4: 
Whether rich or poor, his heart is content,
    a smile ever on his face.

    5: 
    6: 1 
Happy the husband of a good wife;
    the number of his days will be doubled.
2 
A loyal wife brings joy to her husband,
    and he will finish his years in peace.
3 
A good wife is a generous gift
    bestowed upon him who fears the Lord.
4 
Whether rich or poor, his heart is content,
    a smile ever on his face.
5 
There are three things I dread,
    and a fourth which terrifies me:
Public slander, the gathering of a mob,
    and false accusation—all harder to bear than death.
6 
A wife jealous of another wife is heartache and mourning;[b]
    everyone feels the lash of her tongue.

    7: 
A wicked wife is a chafing yoke;
    taking hold of her is like grasping a scorpion.

    8: 
A drunken wife arouses great anger,
    for she does not hide her shame.

    9: By her haughty stare and her eyelids
    an unchaste wife can be recognized.

    10: 
Keep a strict watch over an unruly wife,
    lest, finding an opportunity, she use it;

    11: 
Watch out for her impudent eye,
    and do not be surprised if she betrays you:

    12: 
As a thirsty traveler opens his mouth
    and drinks from any water nearby,
So she sits down before every tent peg
    and opens her quiver for every arrow.

    13: 
A gracious wife delights her husband;
    her thoughtfulness puts flesh on his bones.

    14: 
A silent wife is a gift from the Lord;
    nothing is worth more than her self-discipline.

    15: 
A modest wife is a supreme blessing;
    no scales can weigh the worth of her chastity.

    16: 
The sun rising in the Lord’s heavens—
    the beauty of a good wife in her well-ordered home.

    17: 
The light which shines above the holy lampstand—
    a beautiful face on a stately figure.

    18: 
Golden columns on silver bases—
    so her shapely legs and steady feet.
Dangers to Integrity and Friendship
28 
[e]Two things bring grief to my heart,
    and a third arouses my anger:
The wealthy reduced to want,
    the intelligent held in contempt,
And those who pass from righteousness to sin—
    the Lord prepares them for the sword.
29 
A merchant can hardly keep from wrongdoing,
    nor can a shopkeeper stay free from sin;


  Chapter 27.

    1: 
    2: 
1 
For the sake of profit many sin,
    and the struggle for wealth blinds the eyes.
2 
A stake will be driven between fitted stones—
    sin will be wedged in between buying and selling.

    3: 
Unless one holds fast to the fear of the Lord,
    with sudden swiftness will one’s house be thrown down.

    4: 
When a sieve is shaken, the husks appear;
    so do people’s faults when they speak.

    5: 
The furnace tests the potter’s vessels;
    the test of a person is in conversation.

    6: 
    7: 1 
For the sake of profit many sin,
    and the struggle for wealth blinds the eyes.
2 
A stake will be driven between fitted stones—
    sin will be wedged in between buying and selling.
3 
Unless one holds fast to the fear of the Lord,
    with sudden swiftness will one’s house be thrown down.
4 
When a sieve is shaken, the husks appear;
    so do people’s faults when they speak.
5 
The furnace tests the potter’s vessels;
    the test of a person is in conversation.
6 
The fruit of a tree shows the care it has had;
    so speech discloses the bent of a person’s heart.
7 
Praise no one before he speaks,
    for it is then that people are tested.

    8: 
If you strive after justice, you will attain it,
    and wear it like a splendid robe.

    9: Birds nest with their own kind,
    and honesty comes to those who work at it.

    10: 
A lion lies in wait for prey,
    so does sin for evildoers.

    11: 
The conversation of the godly is always wisdom,
    but the fool changes like the moon.

    12: 
Limit the time you spend among the stupid,
    but frequent the company of the thoughtful.

    13: 
The conversation of fools is offensive,
    and their laughter is wanton sin.

    14: 
Their oath-filled talk makes the hair stand on end,
    and their brawls make one stop the ears.

    15: 
The wrangling of the proud ends in bloodshed,
    and their cursing is painful to hear.

    16: 
Whoever betrays a secret destroys confidence,
    and will never find a congenial friend.

    17: 
Cherish your friend, keep faith with him;
    but if you betray his secrets, do not go after him;

    18: 
For as one might kill another,
    you have killed your neighbor’s friendship.

    19: 
Like a bird released from your hand,
    you have let your friend go and cannot recapture him.

    20: 
Do not go after him, for he is far away,
    and has escaped like a gazelle from a snare.

    21: 
For a wound can be bandaged, and an insult forgiven,
    but whoever betrays secrets does hopeless damage.
Malice, Anger and Vengeance

    22: 
Whoever has shifty eyes plots mischief
    and those who know him will keep their distance;

    23: 
In your presence he uses honeyed talk,
    and admires your words,
But later he changes his tone
    and twists the words to your ruin.

    24: 
I have hated many things but not as much as him,
    and the Lord hates him as well.

    25: 
A stone falls back on the head of the one who throws it high,
    and a treacherous blow causes many wounds.

    26: 
    27: 1 
For the sake of profit many sin,
    and the struggle for wealth blinds the eyes.
2 
A stake will be driven between fitted stones—
    sin will be wedged in between buying and selling.
3 
Unless one holds fast to the fear of the Lord,
    with sudden swiftness will one’s house be thrown down.
4 
When a sieve is shaken, the husks appear;
    so do people’s faults when they speak.
5 
The furnace tests the potter’s vessels;
    the test of a person is in conversation.
6 
The fruit of a tree shows the care it has had;
    so speech discloses the bent of a person’s heart.
7 
Praise no one before he speaks,
    for it is then that people are tested.
8 
If you strive after justice, you will attain it,
    and wear it like a splendid robe.
9 
Birds nest with their own kind,
    and honesty comes to those who work at it.
10 
A lion lies in wait for prey,
    so does sin for evildoers.
11 
The conversation of the godly is always wisdom,
    but the fool changes like the moon.
12 
Limit the time you spend among the stupid,
    but frequent the company of the thoughtful.
13 
The conversation of fools is offensive,
    and their laughter is wanton sin.
14 
Their oath-filled talk makes the hair stand on end,
    and their brawls make one stop the ears.
15 
The wrangling of the proud ends in bloodshed,
    and their cursing is painful to hear.
16 
Whoever betrays a secret destroys confidence,[b]
    and will never find a congenial friend.
17 
Cherish your friend, keep faith with him;
    but if you betray his secrets, do not go after him;
18 
For as one might kill another,
    you have killed your neighbor’s friendship.
19 
Like a bird released from your hand,
    you have let your friend go and cannot recapture him.
20 
Do not go after him, for he is far away,
    and has escaped like a gazelle from a snare.
21 
For a wound can be bandaged, and an insult forgiven,
    but whoever betrays secrets does hopeless damage.
Malice, Anger and Vengeance
22 
Whoever has shifty eyes plots mischief
    and those who know him will keep their distance;
23 
In your presence he uses honeyed talk,
    and admires your words,
But later he changes his tone
    and twists the words to your ruin.
24 
I have hated many things but not as much as him,
    and the Lord hates him as well.
25 
A stone falls back on the head of the one who throws it high,
    and a treacherous blow causes many wounds.
26 
Whoever digs a pit falls into it,
    and whoever lays a snare is caught in it.[c]
27 
The evil anyone does will recoil on him
    without knowing how it came upon him.

    28: 
Mockery and abuse will befall the arrogant,
    and vengeance lies in wait for them like a lion.

    29: 
Those who rejoice in the downfall of the godly will be caught in a snare,
    and pain will consume them before they die.

    30: 
Wrath and anger, these also are abominations,
    yet a sinner holds on to them.


  Chapter 28.

    1: 
    2: 
1 
The vengeful will face the Lord’s vengeance;
    indeed he remembers their sins in detail.
2 
Forgive your neighbor the wrong done to you;
    then when you pray, your own sins will be forgiven.

    3: 
Does anyone nourish anger against another
    and expect healing from the Lord?

    4: 
Can one refuse mercy to a sinner like oneself,
    yet seek pardon for one’s own sins?

    5: 
If a mere mortal cherishes wrath,
    who will forgive his sins?

    6: 
Remember your last days and set enmity aside;
    remember death and decay, and cease from sin!

    7: 
    8: 1 
The vengeful will face the Lord’s vengeance;
    indeed he remembers their sins in detail.
2 
Forgive your neighbor the wrong done to you;
    then when you pray, your own sins will be forgiven.
3 
Does anyone nourish anger against another
    and expect healing from the Lord?
4 
Can one refuse mercy to a sinner like oneself,
    yet seek pardon for one’s own sins?
5 
If a mere mortal cherishes wrath,
    who will forgive his sins?
6 
Remember your last days and set enmity aside;
    remember death and decay, and cease from sin!
7 
Remember the commandments and do not be angry with your neighbor;
    remember the covenant of the Most High, and overlook faults.
8 
Avoid strife and your sins will be fewer,
    for the hot-tempered kindle strife;

    9: The sinner disrupts friendships
    and sows discord among those who are at peace.

    10: 
The more the wood, the greater the fire,
    the more the cruelty, the fiercer the strife;
The greater the strength, the sterner the anger,
    the greater the wealth, the greater the wrath.

    11: 
Pitch and resin make fire flare up,
    and a hasty quarrel provokes bloodshed.
The Evil Tongue

    12: 
If you blow on a spark, it turns into flame,
    if you spit on it, it dies out;
    yet both you do with your mouth!

    13: 
Cursed be gossips and the double-tongued,
    for they destroy the peace of many.

    14: 
A meddlesome tongue subverts many,
    and makes them refugees among peoples.
It destroys strong cities,
    and overthrows the houses of the great.

    15: 
A meddlesome tongue drives virtuous women from their homes,
    and robs them of the fruit of their toil.

    16: 
Whoever heed it will find no rest,
    nor will they dwell in peace.

    17: 
A blow from a whip raises a welt,
    but a blow from the tongue will break bones.

    18: 
Many have fallen by the edge of the sword,
    but not as many as by the tongue.

    19: 
Happy the one who is sheltered from it,
    and has not endured its wrath;
Who has not borne its yoke
    nor been bound with its chains.

    20: 
For its yoke is a yoke of iron,
    and its chains are chains of bronze;

    21: 
The death it inflicts is an evil death,
    even Sheol is preferable to it.

    22: 
It will have no power over the godly,
    nor will they be burned in its flame.

    23: 
But those who forsake the Lord will fall victim to it,
    as it burns among them unquenchably;
It will hurl itself against them like a lion,
    and like a leopard, it will tear them to pieces.

    24: 
As you fence in your property with thorns,
    so make a door and a bolt for your mouth.

    25: 
As you lock up your silver and gold,
    so make balances and scales for your words.

    26: 
Take care not to slip by your tongue
    and fall victim to one lying in ambush.
