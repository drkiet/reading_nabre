Day 241:

Reading Jeremiah, chapters ['49', '50', '51', '52']:

  Chapter 49.

    1: Concerning the Ammonites. Thus says the Lord:
Has Israel no sons?
    none to inherit?
Why has Milcom disinherited Gad,
    why are his people living in its cities?

    2: 
Therefore the days are coming—oracle of the Lord—
    when I will sound the battle alarm
    against Rabbah of the Ammonites;
It shall become a mound of ruins,
    and its villages destroyed by fire.
Israel shall then inherit those who disinherited it—
    oracle of the Lord.

    3: 
    4: 
Against the Ammonites. 1 Concerning the Ammonites. Thus says the Lord:
Has Israel no sons?
    none to inherit?
Why has Milcom disinherited Gad,
    why are his people living in its cities?
2 
Therefore the days are coming—oracle of the Lord—
    when I will sound the battle alarm
    against Rabbah of the Ammonites;
It shall become a mound of ruins,
    and its villages destroyed by fire.
Israel shall then inherit those who disinherited it—
    oracle of the Lord.
3 
Wail, Heshbon, “The ruin is destroyed!”
    shriek, villages of Rabbah!
Put on sackcloth and lament!
    Run back and forth in the sheepfolds.
For Milcom is going into exile,
    taking priest and prince with him.
4 
Why boast in your strength,
    your ebbing strength, rebellious daughter?
Why trust in your treasures, saying,
    “Who would dare attack me?”

    5: 
See, I am bringing terror upon you—
    oracle of the Lord God of hosts—
    from all around you;
You shall be scattered, each in headlong flight,
    with no one to gather the fugitives.

    6: 
But afterward I will restore the fortunes
    of the Ammonites—oracle of the Lord.
Against Edom. 
    7: Concerning Edom. Thus says the Lord of hosts:
Is there no more wisdom in Teman,
    has counsel perished from the prudent,
    is their wisdom gone?

    8: 
    9: gainst the Ammonites. 1 Concerning the Ammonites. Thus says the Lord:
Has Israel no sons?
    none to inherit?
Why has Milcom disinherited Gad,
    why are his people living in its cities?
2 
Therefore the days are coming—oracle of the Lord—
    when I will sound the battle alarm
    against Rabbah of the Ammonites;
It shall become a mound of ruins,
    and its villages destroyed by fire.
Israel shall then inherit those who disinherited it—
    oracle of the Lord.
3 
Wail, Heshbon, “The ruin is destroyed!”
    shriek, villages of Rabbah!
Put on sackcloth and lament!
    Run back and forth in the sheepfolds.
For Milcom is going into exile,
    taking priest and prince with him.
4 
Why boast in your strength,
    your ebbing strength, rebellious daughter?
Why trust in your treasures, saying,
    “Who would dare attack me?”
5 
See, I am bringing terror upon you—
    oracle of the Lord God of hosts—
    from all around you;
You shall be scattered, each in headlong flight,
    with no one to gather the fugitives.
6 
But afterward I will restore the fortunes
    of the Ammonites—oracle of the Lord.
Against Edom.[b] 7 Concerning Edom. Thus says the Lord of hosts:
Is there no more wisdom in Teman,[c]
    has counsel perished from the prudent,
    is their wisdom gone?
8 
Flee, retreat, hide deep for lodging,
    inhabitants of Dedan:
For I bring disaster upon Esau[d]
    when I come to punish them.
9 
If vintagers came upon you,
    they would leave no gleanings;
If thieves by night,
    they would destroy as they pleased.

    10: 
So I myself will strip Esau;
    I will uncover his lairs so he cannot hide.
Offspring and family are destroyed,
    neighbors, too; he is no more.

    11: 
Leave your orphans behind, I will keep them alive;
    your widows, let them trust in me.

    12: For thus says the Lord: Look, even those not sentenced to drink the cup must drink it! Shall you then go unpunished? You shall not! You shall drink every bit of it! 
    13: By myself I have sworn—oracle of the Lord—Bozrah shall become an object of horror, a disgrace, a desolation, and a curse. Bozrah and all its cities shall become ruins forever.

    14: 
I have heard a report from the Lord,
    a herald has been sent among the nations:
“Gather together, move against it,
    get ready for battle!”

    15: 
I will make you the least among the nations,
    despised by all people!

    16: 
The terror you spread,
    the pride of your heart, beguiled you.
You denizens of rocks and crevices,
    occupying towering peaks:
Though you build your nest high as the eagle,
    from there I will bring you down—oracle of the Lord.

    17: Edom shall become an object of horror. Passersby recoil in terror, hissing at all its wounds. 
    18: As when Sodom, Gomorrah, and their neighbors were overthrown—oracle of the Lord—no one shall live in it, nor anyone settle there.

    19: 
As when a lion comes up from a thicket of the Jordan
    to a permanent pasture,
So in an instant, I will chase them off;
    I will establish there whomever I choose.
For who is like me? Who holds me accountable?
    What shepherd can stand against me?

    20: 
Therefore, listen to the strategy
    the Lord devised for Edom;
The plans he has drawn up
    against the inhabitants of Teman:
They shall be dragged away, even the smallest of the flock;
    their pasture shall be aghast because of them.

    21: 
With the din of their collapse the earth quakes,
    to the Red Sea the outcry is heard!

    22: 
Look! like an eagle he soars aloft,
    and spreads his wings over Bozrah;
On that day the hearts of Edom’s warriors become
    like the heart of a woman in labor.
Against Damascus. 
    23: Concerning Damascus.
Hamath and Arpad are shamed,
    for they have heard bad news;
Anxious, they surge like the sea
    which cannot calm down.

    24: 
Damascus loses heart, turns to flee;
    panic has seized it.
Distress and pangs take hold,
    like the pain of a woman in labor.

    25: 
How can the glorious city be abandoned,
    the town of joy!

    26: 
But now its young men shall fall in its squares,
    all the warriors destroyed on that day—
    oracle of the Lord of hosts.

    27: 
I will set fire to the wall of Damascus;
    it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
Against Arabia. 
    28: About Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, defeated.
Thus says the Lord:
Rise up, attack Kedar,
    destroy the people from the east.

    29: 
Their tents and flocks shall be taken away,
    their tent curtains and all their goods;
Their camels they carry off,
    they shout over them, “Terror on every side!”

    30: 
Flee! wander about, hide deep for lodging,
    inhabitants of Hazor—oracle of the Lord;
For Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, has devised a strategy against you,
    drawn up a plan against you,

    31: 
Get up! set out against a tranquil nation,
    living in security—oracle of the Lord—
Without gates or bars,
    dwelling alone.

    32: 
Their camels shall become spoils,
    their hordes of cattle, plunder;
I will scatter to the winds those who shave their temples;
    from every side I will bring their ruin—
    oracle of the Lord.

    33: 
Hazor shall become a haunt for jackals,
    a wasteland forever,
Where no one lives,
    no mortal stays.
Against Elam. 
    34: The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah:

    35: 
Thus says the Lord of hosts:
Look! I will break the bow of Elam,
    the mainstay of their might.

    36: 
I will bring upon Elam the four winds
    from the four ends of the heavens:
I will scatter them to all these winds, until there is no nation
    to which the outcasts of Elam have not gone.

    37: 
I will terrify Elam before their foes,
    those seeking their life;
I will bring evil upon them,
    my burning wrath—oracle of the Lord.
I will send sword after them
    until I have finished them off;

    38: 
I will set up my throne in Elam
    and destroy from there king and princes—
    oracle of the Lord.

    39: 
But at the end of days I will restore
    the fortunes of Elam—oracle of the Lord.


  Chapter 50.

    1: The word the Lord spoke against Babylon, against the land of the Chaldeans, through Jeremiah the prophet:

    2: 
Proclaim this among the nations, announce it!
    Announce it, do not hide it, but say:
Babylon is captured, Bel put to shame, Marduk terrified;
    its images are put to shame, its idols shattered.

    3: 
A nation from the north advances against it,
    making the land desolate
So that no one can live there;
    human beings and animals have fled.

    4: 
    5: 
The First Oracle Against Babylon. 1 The word the Lord spoke against Babylon, against the land of the Chaldeans, through Jeremiah the prophet:
2 
Proclaim this among the nations, announce it!
    Announce it, do not hide it, but say:
Babylon is captured, Bel[b] put to shame, Marduk terrified;
    its images are put to shame, its idols shattered.
3 
A nation from the north advances against it,
    making the land desolate
So that no one can live there;
    human beings and animals have fled.
4 
In those days and at that time—oracle of the Lord—
    Israelite and Judahite shall come together,
Weeping as they come, to seek the Lord, their God;
5 
They shall ask for Zion,
    seeking out the way.
“Come, let us join ourselves to the Lord
    in an everlasting covenant, never to be forgotten.”

    6: 
Lost sheep were my people,
    their shepherds misled them,
    leading them astray on the mountains;
From mountain to hill they wandered,
    forgetting their fold.

    7: 
Whoever happened upon them devoured them;
    their enemies said, “We are not guilty,
Because they sinned against the Lord,
    the abode of justice, the hope of their ancestors.”

    8: 
Flee from the midst of Babylon,
    leave the land of the Chaldeans,
    be like rams at the head of the flock.

    9: See, I am stirring up against Babylon
    a band of great nations from the land of the north;
They are arrayed against her,
    from there she shall be taken.
Their arrows are like the arrows of a skilled warrior
    who never returns empty-handed.

    10: 
Chaldea shall become plunder;
    all its plunderers shall be enriched—
    oracle of the Lord.

    11: 
Yes, rejoice and exult,
    you that plunder my heritage;
Frisk like calves on the grass,
    neigh like stallions!

    12: 
Your mother will indeed be put to shame,
    she that bore you shall be abashed;
See, the last of the nations,
    a wilderness, a dry wasteland.

    13: 
Because of the Lord’s wrath it shall be uninhabited,
    become an utter wasteland;
Everyone who passes by Babylon will be appalled
    and hiss at all its wounds.

    14: 
Take your posts encircling Babylon,
    you who bend the bow;
Shoot at it, do not spare your arrows,

    15: 
    raise the war cry against it on every side.
It surrenders, its bastions fall,
    its walls are torn down:
This is retribution from the Lord! Take retribution on her,
    as she has done, do to her;
    for she sinned against the Lord.

    16: 
Cut off the sower from Babylon
    and those who wield sickles at harvest time!
Before the destroying sword,
    all of them turn back to their own people,
    all flee to their own land.

    17: 
Israel was a stray sheep
    that lions pursued;
The king of Assyria once devoured him;
    now Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon gnaws his bones.

    18: 
Therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:
I will punish the king of Babylon and his land,
    as I once punished the king of Assyria;

    19: 
But I will bring Israel back to its pasture,
    to feed on Carmel and Bashan,
And on Mount Ephraim and Gilead,
    until they have their fill.

    20: In those days, at that time—oracle of the Lord:
The guilt of Israel may be sought, but it no longer exists,
    the sin of Judah, but it can no longer be found;
    for I will forgive the remnant I preserve.

    21: 
Attack the land of Merathaim,
    and those who live in Pekod;
Slaughter and put them under the ban—oracle of the Lord—
    do all I have commanded you.

    22: 
Battle alarm in the land,
    great destruction!

    23: 
How the hammer of the whole earth
    has been cut off and broken!
What an object of horror
    Babylon has become among the nations!

    24: 
You ensnared yourself and were caught,
    Babylon, before you knew it!
You were discovered and seized,
    because you challenged the Lord.

    25: 
The Lord opens his armory,
    brings out the weapons of his wrath;
The Lord God of hosts has work to do
    in the land of the Chaldeans.

    26: 
Come upon them from every side,
    open their granaries,
Pile them up in heaps and put them under the ban;
    do not leave a remnant.

    27: 
Slay all the oxen,
    take them down to slaughter;
Woe to them! their day has come,
    the time of their punishment.

    28: 
Listen! the fugitives, the refugees
    from the land of Babylon:
They announce in Zion
    the retribution of the Lord, our God.

    29: 
Call archers out against Babylon,
    all who bend the bow;
Encamp around them;
    let no one escape.
Repay them for their deeds;
    what they have done, do to them,
For they insulted the Lord,
    the Holy One of Israel.

    30: 
Therefore their young men shall fall in the squares,
    all their warriors shall be stilled on that day—
    oracle of the Lord.

    31: 
I am against you, O Insolence—
    oracle of the Lord God of hosts;
For your day has come,
    the time for me to punish you.

    32: 
Insolence stumbles and falls;
    there is no one to raise him up.
I will kindle a fire in his cities
    to devour everything around him.

    33: 
    Thus says the Lord of hosts:
Oppressed are the people of Israel,
    together with the people of Judah;
All their captors hold them fast
    and refuse to let them go.

    34: 
Strong is their Redeemer,
    whose name is Lord of hosts,
The sure defender of their cause,
    who gives rest to their land,
    but unrest to those who live in Babylon.

    35: 
A sword upon the Chaldeans—oracle of the Lord—
    upon the inhabitants of Babylon, her princes and sages!

    36: 
A sword upon the soothsayers,
    and they become fools!
A sword upon the warriors,
    and they tremble;

    37: 
A sword upon their motley throng,
    and they become women!
A sword upon their treasures,
    and they are plundered;

    38: 
A drought upon the waters,
    and they dry up!
For it is a land of idols,
    soon made frantic by phantoms.

    39: 
Hence, wildcats shall dwell there with hyenas,
    and ostriches occupy it;
Never again shall it be inhabited or settled,
    from age to age.

    40: 
As happened when God overturned Sodom
    and Gomorrah and their neighbors—oracle of the Lord—
No one shall dwell there,
    no mortal shall settle there.

    41: 
See, a people comes from the north,
    a great nation, and mighty kings
    rising from the ends of the earth.

    42: 
Bow and javelin they wield,
    cruel and pitiless are they;
They sound like the roaring sea,
    as they ride forth on horses,
Each in place for battle
    against you, daughter Babylon.

    43: 
The king of Babylon hears news of them,
    and his hands hang helpless;
Anguish takes hold of him,
    like the pangs of a woman giving birth.

    44: 
As happens when a lion comes up from a thicket of the Jordan
    to permanent pasture,
So I, in an instant, will chase them off,
    and establish there whomever I choose!
For who is like me? Who can call me to account?
    What shepherd can stand against me?

    45: 
Therefore, hear the strategy of the Lord,
    which he has devised against Babylon;
Hear the plans drawn up
    against the land of the Chaldeans:
They shall be dragged away, even the smallest sheep;
    their own pasture aghast because of them.

    46: 
At the cry “Babylon is captured!” the earth quakes;
    the outcry is heard among the nations.


  Chapter 51.

    1: The Second Oracle Against Babylon
1 
    Thus says the Lord:
See! I rouse against Babylon,
    and the inhabitants of Chaldea,
    a destroyer wind.

    2: 
To Babylon I will send winnowers
    to winnow and lay waste the land;
They shall besiege it on every side
    on the day of affliction.

    3: 
How can the archers draw back their bows,
    lift their armor?
Do not spare her young men,
    put the entire army under the ban.

    4: 
    5: 
The Second Oracle Against Babylon
1 
    Thus says the Lord:
See! I rouse against Babylon,
    and the inhabitants of Chaldea,
    a destroyer wind.
2 
To Babylon I will send winnowers
    to winnow and lay waste the land;
They shall besiege it on every side
    on the day of affliction.
3 
How can the archers draw back their bows,
    lift their armor?
Do not spare her young men,
    put the entire army under the ban.
4 
The slain shall fall in the land of Chaldea,
    the wounded, in its streets;
5 
For Israel and Judah are not left widowed
    by their God, the Lord of hosts,
Even though the land is full of guilt
    against the Holy One of Israel.

    6: 
Flee from Babylon;
    each of you save your own life,
    do not perish because of her guilt;
This is a time of retribution from the Lord,

    7: 
    who pays out her due.
Babylon was a golden cup in the hand of the Lord
    making the whole earth drunk;
The nations drank its wine,
    thus they have gone mad.

    8: 
Babylon suddenly falls and is broken:
    wail over her!
Bring balm for her wounds,
    in case she can be healed.

    9: “We have tried to heal Babylon,
    but she cannot be healed.
    Leave her, each of us must go to our own land.”
The judgment against her reaches the heavens,
    it touches the clouds.

    10: 
The Lord has brought forth our vindication;
    come, let us tell in Zion
    what the Lord, our God, has done.

    11: 
Sharpen the arrows,
    fill the quivers;
The Lord has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes,
    for his resolve is Babylon’s destruction.
Yes, it is retribution from the Lord,
    retribution for his temple.

    12: 
Over the walls of Babylon raise a signal,
    reinforce the watch;
Post sentries,
    arrange ambushes!
For the Lord has both planned and carried out
    what he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.

    13: 
You who dwell by mighty waters,
    rich in treasure,
Your end has come,
    the time at which you shall be cut off!

    14: 
The Lord of hosts has sworn by himself:
    I will fill you with people as numerous as locusts,
    who shall raise over you a joyous shout!

    15: 
He made the earth by his power,
    established the world by wisdom,
    and by his skill stretched out the heavens.

    16: 
When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar,
    he summons clouds from the ends of the earth,
Makes lightning flash in the rain,
    and brings out winds from their storehouses.

    17: 
Every man is stupid, ignorant;
    every artisan is put to shame by his idol:
He molds a fraud,
    without life-breath.

    18: 
They are nothing, a ridiculous work,
    that will perish at the time of punishment.

    19: 
Jacob’s portion is nothing like them:
    he is the creator of all things.
Israel is his very own tribe;
    Lord of hosts is his name.

    20: 
You are my hammer,
    a weapon for war;
With you I shatter nations,
    with you I destroy kingdoms.

    21: 
With you I shatter horse and rider,
    with you I shatter chariot and driver.

    22: 
With you I shatter man and woman,
    with you I shatter old and young,
    with you I shatter the young man and young woman.

    23: 
With you I shatter shepherd and flock,
    with you I shatter farmer and team,
    with you I shatter governors and officers.

    24: 
Thus I will repay Babylon,
    all the inhabitants of Chaldea,
For all the evil they committed against Zion,
    before your very eyes—oracle of the Lord.

    25: 
Beware! I am against you,
    destroying mountain—oracle of the Lord—
    destroyer of the entire earth,
I will stretch forth my hand against you,
    roll you down over the cliffs,
    and make you a burnt mountain:

    26: 
They will not take from you a cornerstone,
    or a foundation stone;
You shall remain ruins forever—
    oracle of the Lord.

    27: 
Raise a signal in the land,
    sound the trumpet among the nations;
Dedicate nations for war against her,
    summon against her the kingdoms:
    Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz;
Appoint a recruiting officer against her,
    dispatch horses like bristling locusts.

    28: 
Dedicate nations for war against her:
    the king of the Medes,
Its governors and all its officers,
    every land in its domain.

    29: 
The earth quakes and writhes,
    the Lord’s plan against Babylon is carried out,
Turning the land of Babylon
    into a wasteland without inhabitants.

    30: 
Babylon’s warriors have ceased to fight,
    they remain in their strongholds;
Dried up is their strength,
    they have become women.
Burned down are their homes,
    broken their gates.

    31: 
One runner meets another,
    herald meets herald,
Telling the king of Babylon
    that his entire city has been taken.

    32: 
The fords have been seized,
    marshes set on fire,
    warriors panic.

    33: For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:
Daughter Babylon is like a threshing floor
    at the time of treading;
Yet a little while,
    and the harvest time will come for her.

    34: 
“He consumed me, defeated me,
    Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon;
    he left me like an empty vessel,
Swallowed me like a sea monster,
    filled his belly with my delicacies and cast me out.

    35: 
Let my torn flesh be visited upon Babylon,”
    says enthroned Zion;
“My blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,”
    says Jerusalem.

    36: 
But now, thus says the Lord:
I will certainly defend your cause,
    I will certainly avenge you;
I will dry up her sea,
    and drain her fountain.

    37: 
Babylon shall become a heap of ruins,
    a haunt of jackals;
A place of horror and hissing,
    without inhabitants.

    38: 
They roar like lions,
    growl like lion cubs.

    39: 
When they are parched, I will set drink before them
    to make them drunk, that they may be overcome
    with everlasting sleep, never to awaken—
    oracle of the Lord.

    40: 
I will bring them down like lambs to slaughter,
    like rams and goats.

    41: 
How she has been seized, taken captive,
    the glory of the whole world!
What a horror Babylon has become among the nations:

    42: 
    against Babylon the sea rises,
    she is overwhelmed by roaring waves!

    43: 
Her cities have become wasteland,
    a parched and arid land
Where no one lives,
    no one passes through.

    44: 
I will punish Bel in Babylon,
    and make him vomit up what he swallowed;
    nations shall no longer stream to him.
Even the wall of Babylon falls!

    45: 
    Leave her, my people; each of you save your own life
    from the burning wrath of the Lord.

    46: Do not be discouraged when rumors spread through the land; this year one rumor comes, next year another: “Violence in the land!” or “Ruler against ruler!” 
    47: Realize that the days are coming when I will punish the idols of Babylon; the whole land shall be put to shame, all her slain shall fall in her midst. 
    48: Then heaven and earth and everything in them shall shout over Babylon with joy, when the destroyers come against her from the north—oracle of the Lord. 
    49: Babylon, too, must fall, you slain of Israel, because by the hand of Babylon the slain of all the earth have fallen.

    51: The Second Oracle Against Babylon
1 
    Thus says the Lord:
See! I rouse against Babylon,
    and the inhabitants of Chaldea,
    a destroyer wind.
2 
To Babylon I will send winnowers
    to winnow and lay waste the land;
They shall besiege it on every side
    on the day of affliction.
3 
How can the archers draw back their bows,
    lift their armor?
Do not spare her young men,
    put the entire army under the ban.
4 
The slain shall fall in the land of Chaldea,
    the wounded, in its streets;
5 
For Israel and Judah are not left widowed
    by their God, the Lord of hosts,
Even though the land is full of guilt
    against the Holy One of Israel.
6 
Flee from Babylon;
    each of you save your own life,
    do not perish because of her guilt;
This is a time of retribution from the Lord,
7 
    who pays out her due.
Babylon was a golden cup in the hand of the Lord
    making the whole earth drunk;
The nations drank its wine,
    thus they have gone mad.
8 
Babylon suddenly falls and is broken:
    wail over her!
Bring balm for her wounds,
    in case she can be healed.
9 
“We have tried to heal Babylon,
    but she cannot be healed.
    Leave her, each of us must go to our own land.”
The judgment against her reaches the heavens,
    it touches the clouds.
10 
The Lord has brought forth our vindication;
    come, let us tell in Zion
    what the Lord, our God, has done.
11 
Sharpen the arrows,
    fill the quivers;
The Lord has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes,[b]
    for his resolve is Babylon’s destruction.
Yes, it is retribution from the Lord,
    retribution for his temple.
12 
Over the walls of Babylon raise a signal,
    reinforce the watch;
Post sentries,
    arrange ambushes!
For the Lord has both planned and carried out
    what he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.
13 
You who dwell by mighty waters,
    rich in treasure,
Your end has come,
    the time at which you shall be cut off!
14 
The Lord of hosts has sworn by himself:
    I will fill you with people as numerous as locusts,
    who shall raise over you a joyous shout!
15 
He made the earth by his power,
    established the world by wisdom,
    and by his skill stretched out the heavens.
16 
When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar,
    he summons clouds from the ends of the earth,
Makes lightning flash in the rain,
    and brings out winds from their storehouses.
17 
Every man is stupid, ignorant;
    every artisan is put to shame by his idol:
He molds a fraud,
    without life-breath.
18 
They are nothing, a ridiculous work,
    that will perish at the time of punishment.
19 
Jacob’s portion is nothing like them:
    he is the creator of all things.
Israel is his very own tribe;
    Lord of hosts is his name.
20 
You are my hammer,
    a weapon for war;
With you I shatter nations,
    with you I destroy kingdoms.
21 
With you I shatter horse and rider,
    with you I shatter chariot and driver.
22 
With you I shatter man and woman,
    with you I shatter old and young,
    with you I shatter the young man and young woman.
23 
With you I shatter shepherd and flock,
    with you I shatter farmer and team,
    with you I shatter governors and officers.
24 
Thus I will repay Babylon,
    all the inhabitants of Chaldea,
For all the evil they committed against Zion,
    before your very eyes—oracle of the Lord.
25 
Beware! I am against you,
    destroying mountain—oracle of the Lord—
    destroyer of the entire earth,
I will stretch forth my hand against you,
    roll you down over the cliffs,
    and make you a burnt mountain:
26 
They will not take from you a cornerstone,
    or a foundation stone;
You shall remain ruins forever—
    oracle of the Lord.
27 
Raise a signal in the land,
    sound the trumpet among the nations;
Dedicate nations for war against her,
    summon against her the kingdoms:
    Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz;[c]
Appoint a recruiting officer against her,
    dispatch horses like bristling locusts.
28 
Dedicate nations for war against her:
    the king of the Medes,
Its governors and all its officers,
    every land in its domain.
29 
The earth quakes and writhes,
    the Lord’s plan against Babylon is carried out,
Turning the land of Babylon
    into a wasteland without inhabitants.
30 
Babylon’s warriors have ceased to fight,
    they remain in their strongholds;
Dried up is their strength,
    they have become women.
Burned down are their homes,
    broken their gates.
31 
One runner meets another,
    herald meets herald,
Telling the king of Babylon
    that his entire city has been taken.
32 
The fords have been seized,
    marshes set on fire,
    warriors panic.
33 For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:
Daughter Babylon is like a threshing floor
    at the time of treading;
Yet a little while,
    and the harvest time will come for her.
34 
“He consumed me, defeated me,
    Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon;
    he left me like an empty vessel,
Swallowed me like a sea monster,
    filled his belly with my delicacies and cast me out.
35 
Let my torn flesh be visited upon Babylon,”
    says enthroned Zion;
“My blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,”
    says Jerusalem.
36 
But now, thus says the Lord:
I will certainly defend your cause,
    I will certainly avenge you;
I will dry up her sea,
    and drain her fountain.
37 
Babylon shall become a heap of ruins,
    a haunt of jackals;
A place of horror and hissing,
    without inhabitants.
38 
They roar like lions,
    growl like lion cubs.
39 
When they are parched, I will set drink before them
    to make them drunk, that they may be overcome
    with everlasting sleep, never to awaken—
    oracle of the Lord.
40 
I will bring them down like lambs to slaughter,
    like rams and goats.
41 
How she has been seized, taken captive,
    the glory of the whole world!
What a horror Babylon has become among the nations:
42 
    against Babylon the sea rises,
    she is overwhelmed by roaring waves!
43 
Her cities have become wasteland,
    a parched and arid land
Where no one lives,
    no one passes through.
44 
I will punish Bel in Babylon,
    and make him vomit up what he swallowed;
    nations shall no longer stream to him.
Even the wall of Babylon falls!
45 
    Leave her, my people; each of you save your own life
    from the burning wrath of the Lord.
46 Do not be discouraged when rumors spread through the land; this year one rumor comes, next year another: “Violence in the land!” or “Ruler against ruler!” 47 Realize that the days are coming when I will punish the idols of Babylon; the whole land shall be put to shame, all her slain shall fall in her midst. 48 Then heaven and earth and everything in them shall shout over Babylon with joy, when the destroyers come against her from the north—oracle of the Lord. 49 Babylon, too, must fall, you slain of Israel, because by the hand of Babylon the slain of all the earth have fallen.
50 
You who have escaped the sword,
    go, do not stand idle;
Remember the Lord from far away,
    let Jerusalem come to mind.
51 
We are ashamed because we have heard taunts,
    disgrace covers our faces;
    strangers have entered sanctuaries in the Lord’s house.

    52: 
Therefore see, the days are coming—oracle of the Lord—
    when I will punish her idols,
    and throughout the land the wounded will groan.

    53: 
Though Babylon scale the heavens,
    and make her strong heights inaccessible,
    my destroyers shall reach her—oracle of the Lord.

    54: 
A sound of crying from Babylon,
    great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans;

    55: 
For the Lord lays Babylon waste,
    silences her loud cry,
Waves roaring like mighty waters,
    a clamor resounding.

    56: 
For the destroyer comes upon her, upon Babylon;
    warriors are captured, their bows broken;
The Lord is a God of recompense,
    he will surely repay.

    57: I will make her princes and sages drunk, with her governors, officers, and warriors, so that they sleep an everlasting sleep, never to awaken—oracle of the King, whose name is Lord of hosts.

    58: 
    Thus says the Lord of hosts:
The walls of spacious Babylon shall be leveled to the ground,
    its lofty gates destroyed by fire.
The toil of the peoples is for nothing;
    the nations weary themselves for what the flames consume.
The Prophecy Sent to Babylon. 
    59: The mission Jeremiah the prophet gave to Seraiah, son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with King Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the fourth year of his reign; Seraiah was chief quartermaster. 
    60: Jeremiah wrote down on one scroll the disaster that would befall Babylon; all these words were written against Babylon. 
    61: And Jeremiah said to Seraiah: “When you reach Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud, 
    62: and then say: Lord, you yourself spoke against this place in order to cut it down so that nothing, human being or beast, could live in it, because it is to remain a wasteland forever. 
    63: When you have finished reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates, 
    64: and say: Thus Babylon shall sink. It will never rise, because of the disaster I am bringing upon it.” Thus far the words of Jeremiah.


  Chapter 52.

    1: 
    2: Capture of Jerusalem. 1 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 2 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as Jehoiakim had done. 
    3: Indeed, the things done in Jerusalem and in Judah so angered the Lord that he cast them out from his presence. Thus Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
    4: 
    5: 
Capture of Jerusalem. 1 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 2 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as Jehoiakim had done. 3 Indeed, the things done in Jerusalem and in Judah so angered the Lord that he cast them out from his presence. Thus Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 4 In the tenth month of the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and his entire army advanced against Jerusalem, encamped around it, and built siege walls on every side. 5 The siege of the city continued until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.

    6: On the ninth day of the fourth month, when famine had gripped the city and the people had no more bread, 
    7: the city walls were breached. All the soldiers fled and left the city by night through the gate between the two walls which was near the king’s garden. With the Chaldeans surrounding the city, they went in the direction of the Arabah. 
    8: But the Chaldean army pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the wilderness near Jericho; his whole army fled from him.

    9: he king, therefore, was arrested and brought to Riblah, in the land of Hamath, to the king of Babylon, who pronounced judgment on him. 
    10: As Zedekiah looked on, the king of Babylon slaughtered his sons before his eyes! All the nobles of Judah were slaughtered at Riblah. 
    11: And the eyes of Zedekiah he then blinded, bound him with chains, and the king of Babylon brought him to Babylon and kept him in prison until the day he died.
Destruction of Jerusalem. 
    12: On the tenth day of the fifth month, this was in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, captain of the bodyguard, came to Jerusalem as the representative of the king of Babylon. 
    13: He burned the house of the Lord, the palace of the king, and all the houses of Jerusalem; every large building he destroyed with fire. 
    14: Then the Chaldean troops with the captain of the guard tore down all the walls that surrounded Jerusalem.

    15: Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, led into exile the remnant of people left in the city, those who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the artisans. 
    16: But Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, left behind some of the country’s poor as vinedressers and farmers.

    17: The bronze pillars that belonged to the house of the Lord, and the wheeled carts and the bronze sea in the house of the Lord, the Chaldeans broke into pieces; they carried away all the bronze to Babylon. 
    18: They also took the pots, shovels, snuffers, bowls, pans, and all the bronze vessels used for service; 
    19: the basins, fire holders, bowls, pots, lampstands, pans, the sacrificial bowls made of gold or silver. Along with these furnishings the captain of the guard carried off 
    20: the two pillars, the one sea and its base of twelve oxen cast in bronze, and the wheeled carts King Solomon had commissioned for the house of the Lord. The bronze from all these furnishings was impossible to weigh.

    21: As for the pillars, each of them was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in diameter; each was four fingers thick and hollow inside. 
    22: A bronze capital five cubits high crowned the one pillar, and a network with pomegranates encircled the capital, all of bronze; and so for the other pillar, with pomegranates. 
    23: There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides, a hundred pomegranates surrounding the network.

    24: The captain of the guard also took Seraiah the high priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the entrance. 
    25: From the city he took one courtier, a commander of soldiers, and seven men in the personal service of the king still in the city, the scribe of the army commander who mustered the people of the land, and sixty of the common people remaining in the city. 
    26: The captain of the guard, Nebuzaradan, arrested them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah, 
    27: who had them struck down and executed in Riblah, in the land of Hamath.
Thus Judah was exiled from the land. 
    28: This is the number of people Nebuchadnezzar led away captive: in his seventh year, three thousand twenty-three people of Judah; 
    29: in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, eight hundred thirty-two persons from Jerusalem; 
    30: in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, deported seven hundred forty-five Judahites: four thousand six hundred persons in all.
Favor Shown to Jehoiachin. 
    31: In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, Evil-merodach, king of Babylon, in the inaugural year of his reign, raised up Jehoiachin, king of Judah, and released him from prison. 
    32: He spoke kindly to him and gave him a throne higher than the thrones of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. 
    33: Jehoiachin took off his prison garb and ate at the king’s table as long as he lived. 
    34: The allowance given him by the king of Babylon was a perpetual allowance, in fixed daily amounts, all the days of his life until the day of his death.
