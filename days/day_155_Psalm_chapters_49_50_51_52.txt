    4: 
Confidence in God Rather than in Riches
1 For the leader. A psalm of the Korahites.[b]
2 
Hear this, all you peoples!
    Give ear, all who inhabit the world,
3 
You of lowly birth or high estate,
    rich and poor together.
4 
My mouth shall speak words of wisdom,
    my heart shall offer insights.

    5: 
I will turn my ear to a riddle,
    expound my question on a lyre.
I

    6: 
Why should I fear in evil days,
    with the iniquity of my assailants surrounding me,

    7: 
Of those who trust in their wealth
    and boast of their abundant riches?

8 
[d]No man can ransom even a brother,
    or pay to God his own ransom.
9 
The redemption of his soul is costly;
    and he will pass away forever.

    10: 
Will he live on forever, then,
    and never see the Pit of Corruption?

    11: 
Indeed, he will see that the wise die,
    and the fool will perish together with the senseless,
    and they leave their wealth to others.

    12: 
Their tombs are their homes forever,
    their dwellings through all generations,
    “They named countries after themselves”

    13: 
    —but man does not abide in splendor.
    He is like the beasts—they perish.
II

    14: 
This is the way of those who trust in themselves,
    and the end of those who take pleasure in their own mouth.
Selah

    15: 
Like a herd of sheep they will be put into Sheol,
    and Death will shepherd them.
Straight to the grave they descend,
    where their form will waste away,
    Sheol will be their palace.

    16: 
But God will redeem my life,
    will take me from the hand of Sheol.
Selah

    17: 
Do not fear when a man becomes rich,
    when the wealth of his house grows great.

    18: 
At his death he will not take along anything,
    his glory will not go down after him.

    19: 
During his life his soul uttered blessings;
    “They will praise you, for you do well for yourself.”

    20: 
But he will join the company of his fathers,
    never again to see the light.

    21: 
In his prime, man does not understand.
    He is like the beasts—they perish.


  Chapter 50.

    1: A psalm of Asaph.
I
The God of gods, the Lord,
    has spoken and summoned the earth
    from the rising of the sun to its setting.

    2: 
From Zion, the perfection of beauty,
God shines forth.

    3: 
Our God comes and will not be silent!
    Devouring fire precedes him,
    it rages strongly around him.

    4: 
    5: 
The Acceptable Sacrifice
1 A psalm of Asaph.
I
The God of gods, the Lord,
    has spoken and summoned the earth
    from the rising of the sun to its setting.
2 
From Zion, the perfection of beauty,
God shines forth.
3 
Our God comes and will not be silent!
    Devouring fire precedes him,
    it rages strongly around him.
4 
He calls to the heavens above
    and to the earth to judge his people:
5 
“Gather my loyal ones to me,
    those who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”

    6: 
The heavens proclaim his righteousness,
    for God himself is the judge.
Selah
II

    7: 
“Listen, my people, I will speak;
    Israel, I will testify against you;
    God, your God, am I.

    8: 
Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you,
    your burnt offerings are always before me.

    9: I will not take a bullock from your house,
    or he-goats from your folds.

    10: 
For every animal of the forest is mine,
    beasts by the thousands on my mountains.

    11: 
I know every bird in the heights;
    whatever moves in the wild is mine.

    12: 
Were I hungry, I would not tell you,
    for mine is the world and all that fills it.

    13: 
Do I eat the flesh of bulls
    or drink the blood of he-goats?

    14: 
Offer praise as your sacrifice to God;
    fulfill your vows to the Most High.

    15: 
Then call on me on the day of distress;
    I will rescue you, and you shall honor me.”
III

    16: 
But to the wicked God says:
    “Why do you recite my commandments
    and profess my covenant with your mouth?

    17: 
You hate discipline;
    you cast my words behind you!

    18: 
If you see a thief, you run with him;
    with adulterers you throw in your lot.

    19: 
You give your mouth free rein for evil;
    you yoke your tongue to deceit.

    20: 
You sit and speak against your brother,
    slandering your mother’s son.

    21: 
When you do these things should I be silent?
    Do you think that I am like you?
    I accuse you, I lay out the matter before your eyes.
IV

    22: 
“Now understand this, you who forget God,
    lest I start ripping apart and there be no rescuer.

    23: 
Those who offer praise as a sacrifice honor me;
    I will let him whose way is steadfast
    look upon the salvation of God.”


  Chapter 51.

    1: a]
The Miserere: Prayer of Repentance
1 For the leader. A psalm of David, 
    2: when Nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone in to Bathsheba.
I

    3: 
Have mercy on me, God, in accord with your merciful love;
    in your abundant compassion blot out my transgressions.

I
3 
Have mercy on me, God, in accord with your merciful love;
    in your abundant compassion blot out my transgressions.
4 
Thoroughly wash away my guilt;
    and from my sin cleanse me.
5 
For I know my transgressions;
    my sin is always before me.

    6: 
Against you, you alone have I sinned;
    I have done what is evil in your eyes
So that you are just in your word,
    and without reproach in your judgment.

    7: 
Behold, I was born in guilt,
    in sin my mother conceived me.

    8: 
Behold, you desire true sincerity;
    and secretly you teach me wisdom.

    9: Cleanse me with hyssop, that I may be pure;
    wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.

    10: 
You will let me hear gladness and joy;
    the bones you have crushed will rejoice.
II

    11: 
Turn away your face from my sins;
    blot out all my iniquities.

    12: 
A clean heart create for me, God;
    renew within me a steadfast spirit.

    13: 
Do not drive me from before your face,
    nor take from me your holy spirit.

    14: 
Restore to me the gladness of your salvation;
    uphold me with a willing spirit.

    15: 
I will teach the wicked your ways,
    that sinners may return to you.

    16: 
Rescue me from violent bloodshed, God, my saving God,
    and my tongue will sing joyfully of your justice.

    17: 
Lord, you will open my lips;
    and my mouth will proclaim your praise.

    18: 
For you do not desire sacrifice or I would give it;
    a burnt offering you would not accept.

    19: 
My sacrifice, O God, is a contrite spirit;
    a contrite, humbled heart, O God, you will not scorn.
III

    20: 
Treat Zion kindly according to your good will;
    build up the walls of Jerusalem.

    21: 
Then you will desire the sacrifices of the just,
    burnt offering and whole offerings;
    then they will offer up young bulls on your altar.


  Chapter 52.

    1: 
    2: a]
The Deceitful Tongue
1 For the leader. A maskil of David, 2 when Doeg the Edomite entered and reported to Saul, saying to him: “David has entered the house of Ahimelech.”
I

    3: 
Why do you glory in what is evil, you who are mighty by the mercy of God?
All day long

    4:

I
3 
Why do you glory in what is evil, you who are mighty by the mercy of God?
All day long
4 
you are thinking up intrigues;
    your tongue is like a sharpened razor,
    you worker of deceit.
5 
You love evil more than good,
    lying rather than saying what is right.
Selah

    6: 
You love all the words that create confusion,
    you deceitful tongue.
II

    7: 
God too will strike you down forever,
    he will lay hold of you and pluck you from your tent,
    uproot you from the land of the living.
Selah

    8: 
The righteous will see and they will fear;
    but they will laugh at him:

    9: “Behold the man! He did not take God as his refuge,
    but he trusted in the abundance of his wealth,
    and grew powerful through his wickedness.”
III

    10: 
But I, like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God,
    I trust in God’s mercy forever and ever.

    11: 
I will thank you forever
    for what you have done.
I will put my hope in your name—for it is good,
    —in the presence of those devoted to you.
