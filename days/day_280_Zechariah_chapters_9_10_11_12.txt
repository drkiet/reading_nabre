Day 280:

Reading Zechariah, chapters ['9', '10', '11', '12']:

  Chapter 9.

    1: 
An oracle: the word of the Lord is against the land of Hadrach,
    and Damascus is its destination,
For the cities of Aram are the Lord’s,
    as are all the tribes of Israel.

    2: 
Hamath also on its border,
    Tyre too, and Sidon, no matter how clever they be.

    3: 
Tyre built itself a stronghold,
    and heaped up silver like dust,
    and gold like the mud of the streets.

    4: 
But now the Lord will dispossess it,
    and cast its wealth into the sea,
    and it will be devoured by fire.

    5: 
Ashkelon will see it and be afraid;
    Gaza too will be in great anguish;
    Ekron also, for its hope will wither.
The king will disappear from Gaza,
    Ashkelon will not be inhabited,

    6: 
    and the illegitimate will rule in Ashdod.
I will destroy the pride of the Philistines

    7: 
    and take from their mouths their bloody prey,
    their disgusting meat from between their teeth.
They will become merely a remnant for our God,
    and will be like a clan in Judah;
    Ekron will be like the Jebusites.

    8: 
    9: estoration of the Land of Israel
1 
An oracle:[b] the word of the Lord is against the land of Hadrach,
    and Damascus is its destination,
For the cities of Aram are the Lord’s,
    as are all the tribes of Israel.
2 
Hamath also on its border,
    Tyre too, and Sidon, no matter how clever they be.
3 
Tyre built itself a stronghold,
    and heaped up silver like dust,
    and gold like the mud of the streets.
4 
But now the Lord will dispossess it,
    and cast its wealth into the sea,
    and it will be devoured by fire.
5 
Ashkelon will see it and be afraid;
    Gaza too will be in great anguish;
    Ekron also, for its hope will wither.
The king will disappear from Gaza,
    Ashkelon will not be inhabited,
6 
    and the illegitimate will rule in Ashdod.
I will destroy the pride of the Philistines
7 
    and take from their mouths their bloody prey,
    their disgusting meat from between their teeth.
They will become merely a remnant for our God,
    and will be like a clan in Judah;
    Ekron will be like the Jebusites.[c]
8 
I will encamp at my house,
    a garrison against invaders;
No oppressor will overrun them again,
    for now I have seen their affliction.
The King’s Entry into Jerusalem[d]
9 
Exult greatly, O daughter Zion!
    Shout for joy, O daughter Jerusalem!
Behold: your king[e] is coming to you,
    a just savior is he,
Humble, and riding on a donkey,
    on a colt, the foal of a donkey.

    10: 
He shall banish the chariot from Ephraim,
    and the horse from Jerusalem;
The warrior’s bow will be banished,
    and he will proclaim peace to the nations.
His dominion will be from sea to sea,
    and from the River to the ends of the earth.
Restoration of the People

    11: 
As for you, by the blood of your covenant,
    I have freed your prisoners from a waterless pit.

    12: 
Return to a fortress,
    O prisoners of hope;
This very day, I announce
    I am restoring double to you.

    13: 
For I have bent Judah as my bow,
    I have set Ephraim as its arrow;
I will arouse your sons, O Zion,
    against your sons, O Yavan,
    and I will use you as a warrior’s sword.

    14: 
The Lord will appear over them,
    God’s arrow will shoot forth as lightning;
The Lord God will sound the ram’s horn,
    and come in a storm from the south.

    15: 
The Lord of hosts will protect them;
    they will devour and conquer with sling stones,
    they will drink and become heated as with wine;
    they will be full like bowls—like the corners of the altar.

    16: 
And the Lord their God will save them:
    the people, like a flock on that day;
For like gemstones of a crown
    they will shine on the land.

    17: 
Then how good and how lovely!
    Grain will make the young men flourish,
    and new wine the young women.


  Chapter 10.

    1: 
The Lord Strengthens Judah and Rescues Ephraim
1 
Ask the Lord for rain in the spring season,
    the Lord who brings storm clouds, and heavy rains,
    who gives to everyone grain in the fields.

    2: 
For the teraphim have spoken nonsense,
    the diviners have seen false visions;
Deceitful dreams they have told,
    empty comfort they have offered.
This is why they wandered like sheep,
    wretched, for they have no shepherd.

    3: 
My wrath is kindled against the shepherds,
    and I will punish the leaders.
For the Lord of hosts attends to the flock, the house of Judah,
    and will make them like a splendid horse in battle.

    4: 
From them will come the tower,
    from them the tent peg,
    from them the bow of war,
    from them every officer.

    5: 
Together they will be like warriors,
    trampling the mud of the streets in battle.
They will wage war because the Lord is with them,
    and will put the horsemen to shame.

    6: 
I will strengthen the house of Judah,
    the house of Joseph I will save;
I will bring them back, because I have mercy on them;
    they will be as if I had never cast them off,
    for I am the Lord their God, and I will answer them.

    7: 
Then Ephraim will be like a hero,
    and their hearts will be cheered as by wine.
Their children will see and rejoice—
    their hearts will exult in the Lord.

    8: 
I will whistle for them and gather them in;
    for I will redeem them
    and they will be as numerous as before.

    9: 
    10: The Lord Strengthens Judah and Rescues Ephraim
1 
Ask the Lord for rain in the spring season,
    the Lord who brings storm clouds, and heavy rains,
    who gives to everyone grain in the fields.
2 
For the teraphim have spoken nonsense,
    the diviners have seen false visions;
Deceitful dreams they have told,
    empty comfort they have offered.
This is why they wandered like sheep,
    wretched, for they have no shepherd.
3 
My wrath is kindled against the shepherds,[b]
    and I will punish the leaders.
For the Lord of hosts attends to the flock, the house of Judah,
    and will make them like a splendid horse in battle.
4 
From them will come the tower,
    from them the tent peg,
    from them the bow of war,
    from them every officer.
5 
Together they will be like warriors,
    trampling the mud of the streets in battle.
They will wage war because the Lord is with them,
    and will put the horsemen to shame.
6 
I will strengthen the house of Judah,
    the house of Joseph[c] I will save;
I will bring them back, because I have mercy on them;
    they will be as if I had never cast them off,
    for I am the Lord their God, and I will answer them.
7 
Then Ephraim will be like a hero,
    and their hearts will be cheered as by wine.
Their children will see and rejoice—
    their hearts will exult in the Lord.
8 
I will whistle for them and gather them in;
    for I will redeem them
    and they will be as numerous as before.[d]
9 
I sowed them among the nations,
    yet in distant lands they will remember me;
    they will bear their children and return.
10 
I will bring them back from the land of Egypt,
    and gather them from Assyria.
To the land of Gilead and to Lebanon I will bring them,
    until no room is found for them.

    11: 
I will cross over to Egypt
    and smite the waves of the sea,
    and all the depths of the Nile will dry up.
The pride of Assyria will be cast down,
    and the scepter of Egypt disappear.

    12: 
I will strengthen them in the Lord,
    in whose name they will walk—oracle of the Lord.


  Chapter 11.

    1: 
The Cry of Trees, Shepherds, and Lions
1 
Open your doors, Lebanon,
    that fire may devour your cedars!

    2: 
Wail, cypress trees,
    for the cedars are fallen,
    the mighty are destroyed!
Wail, oaks of Bashan,
    for the dense forest is cut down!

    3: 
Listen! the wailing of shepherds,
    their glory has been destroyed.
Listen! the roaring of young lions,
    the thickets of the Jordan are destroyed.
The Shepherd Narrative. 
    4: Thus says the Lord, my God: Shepherd the flock to be slaughtered. 
    5: For they who buy them slay them and are not held accountable; while those who sell them say, “Blessed be the Lord, I have become rich!” Even their own shepherds will not pity them. 
    6: For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the earth—oracle of the Lord.—Yes, I will deliver them into each other’s power, or into the power of their kings; they will crush the earth, and I will not deliver it out of their power.

    7: So I shepherded the flock to be slaughtered for the merchants of the flock. I took two staffs: one I called Delight, and the other Union. Thus I shepherded the flock. 
    8: In a single month, I did away with the three shepherds, for I wearied of them, and they disdained me. 
    9: I will not shepherd you,” I said. “Whoever is to die shall die; whoever is to be done away with shall be done away with; and those who are left shall devour one another’s flesh.”

    10: 
    11: The Cry of Trees, Shepherds, and Lions
1 
Open your doors, Lebanon,
    that fire may devour your cedars!
2 
Wail, cypress trees,
    for the cedars are fallen,
    the mighty are destroyed!
Wail, oaks of Bashan,
    for the dense forest is cut down!
3 
Listen! the wailing of shepherds,
    their glory has been destroyed.
Listen! the roaring of young lions,
    the thickets of the Jordan are destroyed.
The Shepherd Narrative. 4 Thus says the Lord, my God: Shepherd the flock to be slaughtered. 5 For they who buy them slay them and are not held accountable; while those who sell them say, “Blessed be the Lord, I have become rich!” Even their own shepherds will not pity them. 6 For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the earth—oracle of the Lord.—Yes, I will deliver them into each other’s power, or into the power of their kings; they will crush the earth, and I will not deliver it out of their power.
7 So I shepherded the flock to be slaughtered for the merchants of the flock. I took two staffs: one I called Delight, and the other Union. Thus I shepherded the flock. 8 In a single month, I did away with the three shepherds, for I wearied of them, and they disdained me. 9 “I will not shepherd you,” I said. “Whoever is to die shall die; whoever is to be done away with shall be done away with; and those who are left shall devour one another’s flesh.”
10 Then I took my staff Delight and snapped it in two, breaking my covenant which I had made with all peoples. 11 So it was broken on that day. The merchants of the flock, who were watching me, understood that this was the word of the Lord. 
    12: Then I said to them, “If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, withhold them.” And they counted out my wages, thirty pieces of silver. 
    13: Then the Lord said to me, Throw it in the treasury—the handsome price at which they valued me. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the treasury in the house of the Lord. 
    14: Then I snapped in two my second staff, Union, breaking the kinship between Judah and Israel.

    15: The Lord said to me: This time take the gear of a foolish shepherd. 
    16: For I am raising up a shepherd in the land who will take no note of those that disappear, nor seek the strays, nor heal the injured, nor feed the exhausted; but he will eat the flesh of the fat ones and tear off their hoofs!
Oracle to the Worthless Shepherd

    17: 
Ah! my worthless shepherd
    who forsakes the flock!
May the sword fall upon his arm
    and upon his right eye;
His arm will surely wither,
    and his right eye surely go blind!


  Chapter 12.

    1: 
    2: Oracles Concerning the Nations and Judah. 1 An oracle:[b] The word of the Lord concerning Israel—oracle of the Lord, who spreads out the heavens, lays the foundations of the earth, and fashions the human spirit within: 2 See, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling[c] for all peoples round about. Judah will be besieged, even Jerusalem. 
    3: On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all peoples. All who attempt to lift it will injure themselves badly, though all the nations of the earth will gather against it. 
    4: On that day—oracle of the Lord—I will strike every horse with fright, and its rider with madness. But over the house of Judah I will keep watch, while I strike blind all the horses of the peoples. 
    5: Then the clans of Judah will say to themselves, “The inhabitants of Jerusalem have their strength in the Lord of hosts, their God.” 
    6: On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a brazier of fire in the woodland and like a burning torch among sheaves, and they will devour right and left all the surrounding peoples; but Jerusalem will again inhabit its own place.

    7: The Lord will save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be exalted over Judah. 
    8: On that day the Lord will shield the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the weakest among them will be like David on that day; and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the Lord before them.

    9: n that day I will seek the destruction of all nations that come against Jerusalem. 
    10: I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of mercy and supplication, so that when they look on him whom they have thrust through, they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and they will grieve for him as one grieves over a firstborn.

Catalogue of Mourners. 11 On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo.[e] 12 And the land shall mourn, each family apart: the family of the house of David, and their women; the family of the house of Nathan, and their women; 
    13: the family of the house of Levi, and their women; the family of Shimei, and their women; 
    14: and all the rest of the families, each family apart, and the women apart.
