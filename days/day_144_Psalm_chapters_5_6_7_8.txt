Attend to the sound of my cry,
    my king and my God!
For to you I will pray, Lord;

I
2 
Give ear to my words, O Lord;
    understand my sighing.
3 
Attend to the sound of my cry,
    my king and my God!
For to you I will pray, Lord;
4 
    in the morning you will hear my voice;
    in the morning I will plead before you and wait.
II
5 
You are not a god who delights in evil;
    no wicked person finds refuge with you;

    6: 
    the arrogant cannot stand before your eyes.
You hate all who do evil;

    7: 
    you destroy those who speak falsely.
A bloody and fraudulent man
    the Lord abhors.
III

    8: 
But I, through the abundance of your mercy,
    will enter into your house.
I will bow down toward your holy sanctuary
    out of fear of you.

    9: Lord, guide me in your justice because of my foes;
    make straight your way before me.
IV

    10: 
For there is no sincerity in their mouth;
    their heart is corrupt.
Their throat is an open grave;
    on their tongue are subtle lies.

    11: 
Declare them guilty, God;
    make them fall by their own devices.
Drive them out for their many sins;
    for they have rebelled against you.
V

    12: 
Then all who trust in you will be glad
    and forever shout for joy.
You will protect them and those will rejoice in you
    who love your name.

    13: 
For you, Lord, bless the just one;
    you surround him with favor like a shield.


  Chapter 6.

    1: For the leader; with stringed instruments, “upon the eighth.”
A psalm of David.
I

    2: 
Do not reprove me in your anger, Lord,
    nor punish me in your wrath.

    3: 
Have pity on me, Lord, for I am weak;
    heal me, Lord, for my bones are shuddering.

    4: 
My soul too is shuddering greatly—
    and you, Lord, how long…?

4 
My soul too is shuddering greatly—
    and you, Lord, how long…?[c]
5 
Turn back, Lord, rescue my soul;
    save me because of your mercy.
6 
For in death there is no remembrance of you.
    Who praises you in Sheol?[d]
II

    7: 
I am wearied with sighing;
    all night long I drench my bed with tears;
    I soak my couch with weeping.

    8: 
My eyes are dimmed with sorrow,
    worn out because of all my foes.
III

    9: Away from me, all who do evil!
    The Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.

    10: 
The Lord has heard my plea;
    the Lord will receive my prayer.

    11: 
My foes will all be disgraced and will shudder greatly;
    they will turn back in sudden disgrace.


  Chapter 7.

    1: A plaintive song of David, which he sang to the Lord concerning Cush, the Benjaminite.
I

    2: 
Lord my God, in you I trusted;
    save me; rescue me from all who pursue me,

    3: 
Lest someone maul me like a lion,
    tear my soul apart with no one to deliver.
II

    4: 
Lord my God, if I have done this,
    if there is guilt on my hands,

    5: 
If I have maltreated someone treating me equitably—
    or even despoiled my oppressor without cause—

    6: 
    7: a]
God the Vindicator
1 A plaintive song of David, which he sang to the Lord concerning Cush, the Benjaminite.
I

II
4 
Lord my God, if I have done this,[b]
    if there is guilt on my hands,
5 
If I have maltreated someone treating me equitably—
    or even despoiled my oppressor without cause—
6 
Then let my enemy pursue and overtake my soul,
    trample my life to the ground,
    and lay my honor in the dust.
Selah
III
7 
Rise up, Lord, in your anger;
    be aroused against the outrages of my oppressors.
    Stir up the justice, my God, you have commanded.

    8: 
Have the assembly of the peoples gather about you;
    and return on high above them,

    9:     the Lord will pass judgment on the peoples.
Judge me, Lord, according to my righteousness,
    and my integrity.

    10: 
Let the malice of the wicked end.
    Uphold the just one,
    O just God,
    who tries hearts and minds.
IV

    11: 
God is a shield above me
    saving the upright of heart.

    12: 
God is a just judge, powerful and patient,
    not exercising anger every day.

    13: 
If one does not repent,
    God sharpens his sword,
    strings and readies the bow,

    14: 
Prepares his deadly shafts,
    makes arrows blazing thunderbolts.
V

    15: 
Consider how one conceives iniquity;
    is pregnant with mischief,
    and gives birth to deception.

    16: 
He digs a hole and bores it deep,
    but he falls into the pit he has made.

    17: 
His malice turns back upon his head;
    his violence falls on his own skull.
VI

    18: 
I will thank the Lord in accordance with his justice;
    I will sing the name of the Lord Most High.

You have established a bulwark against your foes,
    to silence enemy and avenger.

    4: 
When I see your heavens, the work of your fingers,
    the moon and stars that you set in place—

    5: 
What is man that you are mindful of him,
    and a son of man that you care for him?

    crowned him with glory and honor.
