  Chapter 21.

    1: 
    2: 
Thanksgiving and Assurances for the King
1 For the leader. A psalm of David.
I
2 
Lord, the king finds joy in your power;
    in your victory how greatly he rejoices!

    3: 
You have granted him his heart’s desire;
    you did not refuse the request of his lips.
Selah

    4: 
For you welcomed him with goodly blessings;
    you placed on his head a crown of pure gold.

    5: 
He asked life of you;
    you gave it to him,
    length of days forever.

    6: 
Great is his glory in your victory;
    majesty and splendor you confer upon him.

    7: 
You make him the pattern of blessings forever,
    you gladden him with the joy of your face.

    8: 
For the king trusts in the Lord,
    stands firm through the mercy of the Most High.
II

    9: Your hand will find all your enemies;
    your right hand will find your foes!

    10: 
At the time of your coming
    you will make them a fiery furnace.
Then the Lord in his anger will consume them,
    devour them with fire.

    11: 
Even their descendants you will wipe out from the earth,
    their offspring from the human race.

    12: 
Though they intend evil against you,
    devising plots, they will not succeed,

    13: 
For you will put them to flight;
    you will aim at their faces with your bow.
III

    14: 
Arise, Lord, in your power!
    We will sing and chant the praise of your might.


  Chapter 22.

    1: 
    2: 
The Prayer of an Innocent Person
1 For the leader; according to “The deer of the dawn.”[b] A psalm of David.
I
2 
My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?
    Why so far from my call for help,
    from my cries of anguish?

    3: 
My God, I call by day, but you do not answer;
    by night, but I have no relief.

    4: 
Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One;
    you are the glory of Israel.

    5: 
In you our fathers trusted;
    they trusted and you rescued them.

    6: 
To you they cried out and they escaped;
    in you they trusted and were not disappointed.

    7: 
But I am a worm, not a man,
    scorned by men, despised by the people.

    8: 
All who see me mock me;
    they curl their lips and jeer;
    they shake their heads at me:

    9: “He relied on the Lord—let him deliver him;
    if he loves him, let him rescue him.”

    10: 
For you drew me forth from the womb,
    made me safe at my mother’s breasts.

    11: 
Upon you I was thrust from the womb;
    since my mother bore me you are my God.

    12: 
Do not stay far from me,
    for trouble is near,
    and there is no one to help.
II

    13: 
Many bulls surround me;
    fierce bulls of Bashan encircle me.

    14: 
They open their mouths against me,
    lions that rend and roar.

    15: 
Like water my life drains away;
    all my bones are disjointed.
My heart has become like wax,
    it melts away within me.

    16: 
As dry as a potsherd is my throat;
    my tongue cleaves to my palate;
    you lay me in the dust of death.

    17: 
Dogs surround me;
    a pack of evildoers closes in on me.
They have pierced my hands and my feet

    18: 
    I can count all my bones.
They stare at me and gloat;

    19: 
    they divide my garments among them;
    for my clothing they cast lots.

    20: 
But you, Lord, do not stay far off;
    my strength, come quickly to help me.

    by night, but I have no relief.
4

13 
Many bulls[d] surround me;
    fierce bulls of Bashan encircle me.
14 
They open their mouths against me,
    lions that rend and roar.
15 
Like water my life drains away;
    all my bones are disjointed.
My heart has become like wax,
    it melts away within me.
16 
As dry as a potsherd is my throat;
    my tongue cleaves to my palate;
    you lay me in the dust of death.[e]
17 
Dogs surround me;
    a pack of evildoers closes in on me.
They have pierced my hands and my feet
18 
    I can count all my bones.
They stare at me and gloat;
19 
    they divide my garments among them;
    for my clothing they cast lots.
20 
But you, Lord, do not stay far off;
    my strength, come quickly to help me.
21 
Deliver my soul from the sword,
    my life from the grip of the dog.
22 
Save me from the lion’s mouth,
    my poor life from the horns of wild bulls.
III

    23: 
Then I will proclaim your name to my brethren;
    in the assembly I will praise you:

    24: 
“You who fear the Lord, give praise!
    All descendants of Jacob, give honor;
    show reverence, all descendants of Israel!

    25: 
For he has not spurned or disdained
    the misery of this poor wretch,
Did not turn away from me,
    but heard me when I cried out.

    26: 
I will offer praise in the great assembly;
    my vows I will fulfill before those who fear him.

    27: 
The poor will eat their fill;
    those who seek the Lord will offer praise.
    May your hearts enjoy life forever!”
IV

    28: 
All the ends of the earth
    will remember and turn to the Lord;
All the families of nations
    will bow low before him.

    29: 
For kingship belongs to the Lord,
    the ruler over the nations.

    30: 
All who sleep in the earth
    will bow low before God;
All who have gone down into the dust
    will kneel in homage.

    31: 
And I will live for the Lord;
    my descendants will serve you.

    32: 
The generation to come will be told of the Lord,
    that they may proclaim to a people yet unborn
    the deliverance you have brought.

The Lord, Shepherd and Host
1 A psalm of David.
I
The Lord is my shepherd;[b]
    there is nothing I lack.
2 
In green pastures he makes me lie down;
    to still waters he leads me;
3 
    he restores my soul.
He guides me along right paths[c]
    for the sake of his name.

    4: 
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
    I will fear no evil, for you are with me;
    your rod and your staff comfort me.
II

    5: 
You set a table before me
    in front of my enemies;
You anoint my head with oil;
    my cup overflows.

    6: 
Indeed, goodness and mercy will pursue me
    all the days of my life;
I will dwell in the house of the Lord
    for endless days.

    that seeks the face of the God of Jacob.”
