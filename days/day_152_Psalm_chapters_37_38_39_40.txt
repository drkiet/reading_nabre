  Chapter 38.

    1: A psalm of David. For remembrance.
I

    2: 
    3: 
Prayer of an Afflicted Sinner
1 A psalm of David. For remembrance.
I
2 
Lord, do not punish me in your anger;
    in your wrath do not chastise me!
3 
Your arrows have sunk deep in me;
    your hand has come down upon me.

    4: 
There is no wholesomeness in my flesh because of your anger;
    there is no health in my bones because of my sin.

    5: 
My iniquities overwhelm me,
    a burden too heavy for me.
II

    6: 
Foul and festering are my sores
    because of my folly.

    7: 
    8: a]
Prayer of an Afflicted Sinner
1 A psalm of David. For remembrance.
I
2 
Lord, do not punish me in your anger;
    in your wrath do not chastise me!
3 
Your arrows have sunk deep in me;
    your hand has come down upon me.
4 
There is no wholesomeness in my flesh because of your anger;
    there is no health in my bones because of my sin.
5 
My iniquities overwhelm me,
    a burden too heavy for me.
II
6 
Foul and festering are my sores
    because of my folly.
7 
I am stooped and deeply bowed;
    every day I go about mourning.
8 
My loins burn with fever;
    there is no wholesomeness in my flesh.

    9: I am numb and utterly crushed;
    I wail with anguish of heart.

    10: 
My Lord, my deepest yearning is before you;
    my groaning is not hidden from you.

    11: 
My heart shudders, my strength forsakes me;
    the very light of my eyes has failed.

    12: 
Friends and companions shun my disease;
    my neighbors stand far off.

    13: 
Those who seek my life lay snares for me;
    they seek my misfortune, they speak of ruin;
    they plot treachery every day.
III

    14: 
But I am like the deaf, hearing nothing,
    like the mute, I do not open my mouth,

    15: 
I am even like someone who does not hear,
    who has no answer ready.

    16: 
Lord, it is for you that I wait;
    O Lord, my God, you respond.

    17: 
For I have said that they would gloat over me,
    exult over me if I stumble.
IV

    18: 
I am very near to falling;
    my wounds are with me always.

    19: 
I acknowledge my guilt
    and grieve over my sin.

    20: 
My enemies live and grow strong,
    those who hate me grow numerous fraudulently,

    21: 
Repaying me evil for good,
    accusing me for pursuing good.

    22: 
Do not forsake me, O Lord;
    my God, be not far from me!

    23: 
Come quickly to help me,
    my Lord and my salvation!

    3: 
The Vanity of Life
1 For the leader, for Jeduthun. A psalm of David.
I
2 
I said, “I will watch my ways,
    lest I sin with my tongue;
    I will keep a muzzle on my mouth.”
3 
Mute and silent before the wicked,
    I refrain from good things.
But my sorrow increases;

    4: 
    my heart smolders within me.
In my sighing a fire blazes up,
    and I break into speech:
II

    5: 
Lord, let me know my end, the number of my days,
    that I may learn how frail I am.

    6: 
To be sure, you establish the expanse of my days;
    indeed, my life is as nothing before you.
    Every man is but a breath.
Selah
III

    7: 
Man goes about as a mere phantom;
    they hurry about, although in vain;
    he heaps up stores without knowing for whom.

Man goes about as a mere phantom;

8 
And now, Lord, for what do I wait?
    You are my only hope.
9 
From all my sins deliver me;
    let me not be the taunt of fools.

    10: 
I am silent and do not open my mouth
    because you are the one who did this.

    11: 
Take your plague away from me;
    I am ravaged by the touch of your hand.

    12: 
You chastise man with rebukes for sin;
    like a moth you consume his treasures.
    Every man is but a breath.
Selah

    13: 
Listen to my prayer, Lord, hear my cry;
    do not be deaf to my weeping!
For I am with you like a foreigner,
    a refugee, like my ancestors.

    14: 
Turn your gaze from me, that I may smile
    before I depart to be no more.


  Chapter 40.

    1: For the leader. A psalm of David.
A

    2: 
Surely, I wait for the Lord;
    who bends down to me and hears my cry,

    4: 
Gratitude and Prayer for Help
1 For the leader. A psalm of David.
A
2 
Surely, I wait for the Lord;
    who bends down to me and hears my cry,
3 
Draws me up from the pit of destruction,
    out of the muddy clay,
Sets my feet upon rock,
    steadies my steps,
4 
And puts a new song[b] in my mouth,
    a hymn to our God.
Many shall look on in fear
    and they shall trust in the Lord.

    5: 
Blessed the man who sets
    his security in the Lord,
    who turns not to the arrogant
    or to those who stray after falsehood.

    6: 
You, yes you, O Lord, my God,
    have done many wondrous deeds!
And in your plans for us
    there is none to equal you.
Should I wish to declare or tell them,
    too many are they to recount.

    7: 
Sacrifice and offering you do not want;
    you opened my ears.
Holocaust and sin-offering you do not request;

    8: 
    so I said, “See; I come
    with an inscribed scroll written upon me.

    9: I delight to do your will, my God;
    your law is in my inner being!”

    10: 
When I sing of your righteousness
    in a great assembly,
See, I do not restrain my lips;
    as you, Lord, know.

    11: 
I do not conceal your righteousness
    within my heart;
I speak of your loyalty and your salvation.
    I do not hide your mercy or faithfulness from a great assembly.

    12: 
Lord, may you not withhold
    your compassion from me;
May your mercy and your faithfulness
    continually protect me.
B

    13: 
But evils surround me
    until they cannot be counted.
My sins overtake me,
    so that I can no longer see.
They are more numerous than the hairs of my head;
    my courage fails me.

    14: 
Lord, graciously rescue me!
    Come quickly to help me, Lord!

    15: 
May those who seek to destroy my life
    be shamed and confounded.
Turn back in disgrace
    those who desire my ruin.

    16: 
Let those who say to me “Aha!”
    Be made desolate on account of their shame.

    17: 
While those who seek you
    rejoice and be glad in you.
May those who long for your salvation
    always say, “The Lord is great.”

    18: 
Though I am afflicted and poor,
    my Lord keeps me in mind.
You are my help and deliverer;
    my God, do not delay!
