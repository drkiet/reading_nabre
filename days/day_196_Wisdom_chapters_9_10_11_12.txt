Day 196:

Reading Wisdom, chapters ['9', '10', '11', '12']:

  Chapter 9.

    1: 
God of my ancestors, Lord of mercy,
    you who have made all things by your word

    2: 
And in your wisdom have established humankind
    to rule the creatures produced by you,

    3: 
And to govern the world in holiness and righteousness,
    and to render judgment in integrity of heart:

    4: 
Give me Wisdom, the consort at your throne,
    and do not reject me from among your children;

    5: 
For I am your servant, the child of your maidservant,
    a man weak and short-lived
    and lacking in comprehension of judgment and of laws.

    6: 
Indeed, though one be perfect among mortals,
    if Wisdom, who comes from you, be lacking,
    that one will count for nothing.

    7: 
You have chosen me king over your people
    and magistrate over your sons and daughters.

    8: 
    9: olomon’s Prayer
1 
[b]God of my ancestors, Lord of mercy,
    you who have made all things by your word
2 
And in your wisdom have established humankind
    to rule the creatures produced by you,
3 
And to govern the world in holiness and righteousness,
    and to render judgment in integrity of heart:
4 
Give me Wisdom, the consort at your throne,
    and do not reject me from among your children;
5 
For I am your servant, the child of your maidservant,
    a man weak and short-lived
    and lacking in comprehension of judgment and of laws.
6 
Indeed, though one be perfect among mortals,
    if Wisdom, who comes from you, be lacking,
    that one will count for nothing.
7 
You have chosen me king over your people
    and magistrate over your sons and daughters.
8 
You have bid me build a temple on your holy mountain
    and an altar in the city that is your dwelling place,
    a copy of the holy tabernacle which you had established from of old.
9 
Now with you is Wisdom, who knows your works
    and was present when you made the world;
Who understands what is pleasing in your eyes
    and what is conformable with your commands.

    10: 
Send her forth from your holy heavens
    and from your glorious throne dispatch her
That she may be with me and work with me,
    that I may know what is pleasing to you.

    11: 
For she knows and understands all things,
    and will guide me prudently in my affairs
    and safeguard me by her glory;

    12: 
Thus my deeds will be acceptable,
    and I will judge your people justly
    and be worthy of my father’s throne.

    13: 
For who knows God’s counsel,
    or who can conceive what the Lord intends?

    14: 
For the deliberations of mortals are timid,
    and uncertain our plans.

    15: 
For the corruptible body burdens the soul
    and the earthly tent weighs down the mind with its many concerns.

    16: 
Scarcely can we guess the things on earth,
    and only with difficulty grasp what is at hand;
    but things in heaven, who can search them out?

    17: 
Or who can know your counsel, unless you give Wisdom
    and send your holy spirit from on high?

    18: 
Thus were the paths of those on earth made straight,
    and people learned what pleases you,
    and were saved by Wisdom.


  Chapter 10.

    1: 
Wisdom Preserves Her Followers
1 
She preserved the first-formed father[b] of the world
    when he alone had been created;
And she raised him up from his fall,

    2: 
    and gave him power to rule all things.

    3: 
But when an unrighteous man withdrew from her in his anger,
    he perished through his fratricidal wrath.

    4: 
When on his account the earth was flooded, Wisdom again saved it,
    piloting the righteous man on frailest wood.

    5: 
She, when the nations were sunk in universal wickedness,
    knew the righteous man, kept him blameless before God,
    and preserved him resolute against pity for his child.

    6: 
She rescued a righteous man from among the wicked who were being destroyed,
    when he fled as fire descended upon the Pentapolis—

    7: 
Where as a testimony to its wickedness,
    even yet there remain a smoking desert,
Plants bearing fruit that never ripens,
    and the tomb of a disbelieving soul, a standing pillar of salt.

    8: 
For those who forsook Wisdom
    not only were deprived of knowledge of the good,
But also left the world a memorial of their folly,
    so that they could not even be hidden in their fall.

Plants bearing fruit that never ripens,

8 
For those who forsook Wisdom
    not only were deprived of knowledge of the good,
But also left the world a memorial of their folly,
    so that they could not even be hidden in their fall.
9 
But Wisdom rescued from tribulations those who served her.
10 
She, when a righteous man[h] fled from his brother’s anger,
    guided him in right ways,
Showed him the kingdom of God
    and gave him knowledge of holy things;
She prospered him in his labors
    and made abundant the fruit of his works,

    11: 
Stood by him against the greed of his defrauders,
    and enriched him;

    12: 
She preserved him from foes,
    and secured him against ambush,
And she gave him the prize for his hard struggle
    that he might know that devotion to God is mightier than all else.

    13: 
She did not abandon a righteous man when he was sold,
    but rescued him from sin.

    14: 
She went down with him into the dungeon,
    and did not desert him in his bonds,
Until she brought him the scepter of royalty
    and authority over his oppressors,
Proved false those who had defamed him,
    and gave him eternal glory.

    15: 
The holy people and their blameless descendants—it was she
    who rescued them from the nation that oppressed them.

    16: 
She entered the soul of the Lord’s servant,
    and withstood fearsome kings with signs and wonders;

    17: 
    she gave the holy ones the reward of their labors,
Conducted them by a wondrous road,
    became a shelter for them by day
    a starry flame by night.

    18: 
She took them across the Red Sea
    and brought them through the deep waters.

    19: 
Their enemies she overwhelmed,
    and churned them up from the bottom of the depths.

    20: 
Therefore the righteous despoiled the wicked;
    and they sang of your holy name, Lord,
    and praised in unison your conquering hand,

    21: 
Because Wisdom opened the mouths of the mute,
    and gave ready speech to infants.


  Chapter 11.

    1: 
1 
She prospered their affairs through the holy prophet.
III. Special Providence of God During the Exodus
Introduction

    2: 
They journeyed through the uninhabited desert,
    and in lonely places they pitched their tents;

    3: 
    they withstood enemies and warded off their foes.

    4: 
When they thirsted, they called upon you,
    and water was given them from the sheer rock,
    a quenching of their thirst from the hard stone.

    5: 
For by the things through which their foes were punished
    they in their need were benefited.
First Example: Water Punishes the Egyptians and Benefits the Israelites

    6: 
Instead of a river’s perennial source,
    troubled with impure blood

    7: 
    as a rebuke to the decree for the slaying of infants,
You gave them abundant water beyond their hope,

    8: 
    after you had shown by the thirst they experienced
    how you punished their adversaries.

    9: For when they had been tried, though only mildly chastised,
    they recognized how the wicked, condemned in anger, were being tormented.

    10: 
    11: 1 
She prospered their affairs through the holy prophet.

5

First Example: Water Punishes the Egyptians and Benefits the Israelites
6 
Instead of a river’s[b] perennial source,
    troubled with impure blood
7 
    as a rebuke to the decree for the slaying of infants,
You gave them abundant water beyond their hope,
8 
    after you had shown by the thirst they experienced
    how you punished their adversaries.
9 
For when they had been tried, though only mildly chastised,
    they recognized how the wicked, condemned in anger, were being tormented.
10 
You tested your own people, admonishing them as a father;
    but as a stern king you probed and condemned the wicked.
11 
Those near and far were equally afflicted:

    12: 
    for a twofold grief took hold of them
    and a groaning at the remembrance of the ones who had departed.

    13: 
For when they heard that the cause of their own torments
    was a benefit to these others, they recognized the Lord.

    14: 
For though they had mocked and rejected him who had been cast out and abandoned long ago,
    in the final outcome, they marveled at him,
    since their thirst proved unlike that of the righteous.
Second Example: Animals Punish the Egyptians and Benefit the Israelites

    15: 
In return for their senseless, wicked thoughts,
    which misled them into worshiping dumb serpents and worthless insects,
You sent upon them swarms of dumb creatures for vengeance;

    16: 
    that they might recognize that one is punished by the very things through which one sins.
Digression on God’s Mercy

    17: 
For not without means was your almighty hand,
    that had fashioned the universe from formless matter,
    to send upon them many bears or fierce lions,

    18: 
Or newly created, wrathful, unknown beasts
    breathing forth fiery breath,
Or pouring out roaring smoke,
    or flashing terrible sparks from their eyes.

    19: 
Not only could these attack and completely destroy them;
    even their frightful appearance itself could slay.

    20: 
Even without these, they could have been killed at a single blast,
    pursued by justice
    and winnowed by your mighty spirit.
But you have disposed all things by measure and number and weight.

    21: 
For great strength is always present with you;
    who can resist the might of your arm?

    22: 
Indeed, before you the whole universe is like a grain from a balance,
    or a drop of morning dew come down upon the earth.

    23: 
But you have mercy on all, because you can do all things;
    and you overlook sins for the sake of repentance.

    24: 
For you love all things that are
    and loathe nothing that you have made;
    for you would not fashion what you hate.

    25: 
How could a thing remain, unless you willed it;
    or be preserved, had it not been called forth by you?

    26: 
But you spare all things, because they are yours,
    O Ruler and Lover of souls,
1 
    for your imperishable spirit is in all things!


  Chapter 12.

    1: 
    2: 2 
Therefore you rebuke offenders little by little,
    warn them, and remind them of the sins they are committing,
    that they may abandon their wickedness and believe in you, Lord!

    3: 
For truly, the ancient inhabitants of your holy land,

    4: 
    whom you hated for deeds most odious—
    works of sorcery and impious sacrifices;

    5: 
These merciless murderers of children,
    devourers of human flesh,
    and initiates engaged in a blood ritual,

    6: 
    and parents who took with their own hands defenseless lives,
You willed to destroy by the hands of our ancestors,

    7: 
    that the land that is dearest of all to you
    might receive a worthy colony of God’s servants.

    8: 
But even these you spared, since they were but mortals
    and sent wasps as forerunners of your army
    that they might exterminate them by degrees.

    9: Not that you were without power to have the wicked vanquished in battle by the righteous,
    or wiped out at once by terrible beasts or by one decisive word;

    10: 
But condemning them by degrees, you gave them space for repentance.
You were not unaware that their origins were wicked
    and their malice ingrained,
And that their dispositions would never change;

    11: 
    12: 2 
Therefore you rebuke offenders little by little,
    warn them, and remind them of the sins they are committing,
    that they may abandon their wickedness and believe in you, Lord!
3 
For truly, the ancient inhabitants of your holy land,
4 
    whom you hated for deeds most odious—
    works of sorcery and impious sacrifices;
5 
These merciless murderers of children,
    devourers of human flesh,
    and initiates engaged in a blood ritual,
6 
    and parents who took with their own hands defenseless lives,
You willed to destroy by the hands of our ancestors,
7 
    that the land that is dearest of all to you
    might receive a worthy colony of God’s servants.
8 
But even these you spared, since they were but mortals
    and sent wasps as forerunners of your army
    that they might exterminate them by degrees.
9 
Not that you were without power to have the wicked vanquished in battle by the righteous,
    or wiped out at once by terrible beasts or by one decisive word;
10 
But condemning them by degrees, you gave them space for repentance.
You were not unaware that their origins were wicked
    and their malice ingrained,
And that their dispositions would never change;
11 
    for they were a people accursed from the beginning.
Neither out of fear for anyone
    did you grant release from their sins.
12 
For who can say to you, “What have you done?”
    or who can oppose your decree?
Or when peoples perish, who can challenge you, their maker;
    or who can come into your presence to vindicate the unrighteous?

    13: 
For neither is there any god besides you who have the care of all,
    that you need show you have not unjustly condemned;

    14: 
Nor can any king or prince confront you on behalf of those you have punished.

    15: 
But as you are righteous, you govern all things righteously;
    you regard it as unworthy of your power
    to punish one who has incurred no blame.

    16: 
For your might is the source of righteousness;
    your mastery over all things makes you lenient to all.

    17: 
For you show your might when the perfection of your power is disbelieved;
    and in those who know you, you rebuke insolence.

    18: 
But though you are master of might, you judge with clemency,
    and with much lenience you govern us;
    for power, whenever you will, attends you.

    19: 
You taught your people, by these deeds,
    that those who are righteous must be kind;
And you gave your children reason to hope
    that you would allow them to repent for their sins.

    20: 
For these were enemies of your servants, doomed to death;
    yet, while you punished them with such solicitude and indulgence,
    granting time and opportunity to abandon wickedness,

    21: 
With what exactitude you judged your children,
    to whose ancestors you gave the sworn covenants of goodly promises!

    22: 
Therefore to give us a lesson you punish our enemies with measured deliberation
    so that we may think earnestly of your goodness when we judge,
    and, when being judged, we may look for mercy.
Second Example Resumed

    23: 
Hence those unrighteous who lived a life of folly,
    you tormented through their own abominations.

    24: 
For they went far astray in the paths of error,
    taking for gods the worthless and disgusting among beasts,
    being deceived like senseless infants.

    25: 
Therefore as though upon unreasoning children,
    you sent your judgment on them as a mockery;

    26: 
But they who took no heed of a punishment which was but child’s play
    were to experience a condemnation worthy of God.

    27: 
For by the things through which they suffered distress,
    being tortured by the very things they deemed gods,
They saw and recognized the true God whom formerly they had refused to know;
    with this, their final condemnation came upon them.
