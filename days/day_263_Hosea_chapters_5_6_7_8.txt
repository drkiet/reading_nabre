Day 263:

Reading Hosea, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: 
Hear this, priests,
    Pay attention, house of Israel,
Household of the king, give ear!
    For you are responsible for judgment.
But you have been a snare at Mizpah,[b]
    a net spread upon Tabor,

    2: 
a pit dug deep in Shittim.
    Now I will discipline them all.

    3: 
I know Ephraim,
    and Israel is not hidden from me:
Now, Ephraim, you have practiced prostitution,
    Israel is defiled.

    4: 
    5: Guilt of the Religious and Political Leaders
1 
Hear this, priests,
    Pay attention, house of Israel,
Household of the king, give ear!
    For you are responsible for judgment.
But you have been a snare at Mizpah,[b]
    a net spread upon Tabor,
2 
a pit dug deep in Shittim.
    Now I will discipline them all.
3 
I know Ephraim,
    and Israel is not hidden from me:
Now, Ephraim, you have practiced prostitution,
    Israel is defiled.
4 
Their deeds do not allow them
    to return to their God;
For the spirit of prostitution is in them,
    and they do not know the Lord.
5 
The arrogance of Israel bears witness against him;
    Israel and Ephraim stumble because of their iniquity,
    and Judah stumbles with them.

    6: 
With their flocks and herds they will go
    to seek the Lord, but will not find him;
    he has withdrawn from them.

    7: 
They have betrayed the Lord,
    for they have borne illegitimate children;
Now the new moon will devour them
    together with their fields.
Political Upheavals[d]

    8: 
Blow the ram’s horn in Gibeah,
    the trumpet in Ramah!
Sound the alarm in Beth-aven:
    “Look behind you, Benjamin!”

    9: Ephraim shall become a wasteland
    on the day of punishment:
Among the tribes of Israel
    I announce what is sure to be.

    10: 
The princes of Judah have become
    like those who move a boundary line;
Upon them I will pour out
    my wrath like water.

    11: 
Ephraim is oppressed, crushed by judgment,
    for he has willingly gone after filth!

    12: 
I am like a moth for Ephraim,
    like rot for the house of Judah.

    13: 
When Ephraim saw his infirmity,
    and Judah his sore,
Ephraim went to Assyria,
    and sent to the great king.
But he cannot heal you,
    nor take away your sore.

    14: 
For I am like a lion to Ephraim,
    like a young lion to the house of Judah;
It is I who tear the prey and depart,
    I carry it away and no one can save it.
Insincere Conversion

    15: 
I will go back to my place
    until they make reparation
    and seek my presence.
In their affliction, they shall look for me.


  Chapter 6.

    1: 
    “Come, let us return to the Lord,
For it is he who has torn, but he will heal us;
    he has struck down, but he will bind our wounds.

    2: 
He will revive us after two days;
    on the third day he will raise us up,
    to live in his presence.

    3: 
Let us know, let us strive to know the Lord;
    as certain as the dawn is his coming.
He will come to us like the rain,
    like spring rain that waters the earth.”

    4: 
What can I do with you, Ephraim?
    What can I do with you, Judah?
Your loyalty is like morning mist,
    like the dew that disappears early.

    5: 
    6: 1 
    “Come, let us return to the Lord,
For it is he who has torn, but he will heal us;
    he has struck down, but he will bind our wounds.
2 
He will revive us after two days;
    on the third day he will raise us up,
    to live in his presence.
3 
Let us know, let us strive to know the Lord;
    as certain as the dawn is his coming.
He will come to us like the rain,
    like spring rain that waters the earth.”
4 
What can I do with you, Ephraim?
    What can I do with you, Judah?
Your loyalty is like morning mist,
    like the dew that disappears early.
5 
For this reason I struck them down through the prophets,
    I killed them by the words of my mouth;[b]
    my judgment shines forth like the light.
6 
For it is loyalty that I desire, not sacrifice,
    and knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
Further Crimes of Israel

    7: 
But they, at Adam, violated the covenant;
    there they betrayed me.

    8: 
Gilead is a city of evildoers,
    tracked with blood.

    9: Like brigands lying in wait
    is the band of priests.
They murder on the road to Shechem,
    indeed they commit a monstrous crime.

    10: 
In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing:
    there is found Ephraim’s prostitution,
    Israel is defiled.

    11: 
For you also, Judah,
    a harvest has been appointed!


  Chapter 7.

    1: 
    when I would have healed Israel,
The guilt of Ephraim was revealed,
    the wickedness of Samaria:
    They practiced falsehood.
Thieves break in,
    bandits roam outside.

    2: 
Yet they do not call to mind
    that I remember all their wickedness.
Now their crimes surround them,
    present to my sight.
Israel’s Domestic Politics

    3: 
With their wickedness they make the king rejoice,
    the princes too, with their treacherous deeds.

    4: 
They are all adulterers,
    like a blazing oven,
Which the baker quits stoking,
    after the dough’s kneading until its rising.

    5: 
On the day of our king,
    they made the princes sick with poisoned wine;
    he extended his hand to the scoffers.

    6: 
    7: When I would have restored the fortunes of my people,
1 
    when I would have healed Israel,
The guilt of Ephraim was revealed,
    the wickedness of Samaria:
    They practiced falsehood.
Thieves break in,
    bandits roam outside.
2 
Yet they do not call to mind
    that I remember all their wickedness.
Now their crimes surround them,
    present to my sight.
Israel’s Domestic Politics
3 
With their wickedness they make the king rejoice,
    the princes too, with their treacherous deeds.
4 
They are all adulterers,[b]
    like a blazing oven,
Which the baker quits stoking,
    after the dough’s kneading until its rising.
5 
On the day of our king,
    they made the princes sick with poisoned wine;
    he extended his hand to the scoffers.
6 
For they draw near in ambush
    with their hearts like an oven.
All the night their anger sleeps;
    in the morning it flares like a blazing fire.
7 
They are all heated like ovens,
    and consume their rulers.
All their kings have fallen;
    none of them calls upon me.
Israel’s Foreign Politics

    8: 
Ephraim is mixed with the nations,
    Ephraim is an unturned cake.

    9: Strangers have consumed his strength,
    but he does not know it;
Gray hairs are strewn on his head,
    but he takes no notice of it.

    10: 
The arrogance of Israel bears witness against him;
    yet they do not return to the Lord, their God,
    nor seek him, despite all this.

    11: 
Ephraim is like a dove,
    silly and senseless;
They call upon Egypt,
    they go to Assyria.

    12: 
When they go I will spread my net around them,
    like birds in the air I will bring them down.
    I will chastise them when I hear of their assembly.

    13: 
Woe to them, for they have strayed from me!
    Ruin to them, for they have rebelled against me!
Though I wished to redeem them,
    they spoke lies against me.

    14: 
They have not cried to me from their hearts
    when they wailed upon their beds;
For wheat and wine they lacerated themselves;
    they rebelled against me.

    15: 
Though I trained and strengthened their arms,
    yet they devised evil against me.

    16: 
They have again become useless,
    they have been like a treacherous bow.
Their princes shall fall by the sword
    because of the insolence of their tongues;
    thus they shall be mocked in the land of Egypt.


  Chapter 8.

    1: 
Put the trumpet to your lips!
    One like an eagle is over the house of the Lord!
Because they have violated my covenant,
    and rebelled against my law,

    2: 
They cry out to me,
    “My God! We know you!”

    3: 
But Israel has rejected what is good;
    the enemy shall pursue him.

    4: 
They made kings, but not by my authority;
    they established princes, but without my knowledge.
With their silver and gold
    they made idols for themselves,
    to their own destruction.

    5: 
He has rejected your calf, Samaria!
    My wrath is kindled against them;
How long will they be incapable of innocence
    in Israel?

    6: 
An artisan made it,
    it is no god at all.
The calf of Samaria
    will be dashed to pieces.

    7: 
    8: Corruption of Cult, Domestic and Foreign Politics
1 
Put the trumpet to your lips!
    One like an eagle is over the house of the Lord!
Because they have violated my covenant,
    and rebelled against my law,
2 
They cry out to me,
    “My God! We know you!”
3 
But Israel has rejected what is good;
    the enemy[b] shall pursue him.
4 
[c]They made kings, but not by my authority;
    they established princes, but without my knowledge.
With their silver and gold
    they made idols for themselves,
    to their own destruction.
5 
He has rejected your calf,[d] Samaria!
    My wrath is kindled against them;
How long will they be incapable of innocence
    in Israel?
6 
An artisan made it,
    it is no god at all.
The calf of Samaria
    will be dashed to pieces.
7 
When they sow the wind,
    they will reap the whirlwind;
The stalk of grain that forms no head
    can yield no flour;
Even if it could,
    strangers would swallow it.
8 
Israel is swallowed up;
    now they are among the nations,
    like a useless vessel.

    9: For they went up to Assyria—
    a wild ass off on its own—
    Ephraim bargained for lovers.

    10: 
Even though they bargain with the nations,
    I will now gather them together;
They will soon succumb
    under the burden of king and princes.

    11: 
When Ephraim made many altars to expiate sin,
    they became altars for sinning.

    12: 
Though I write for him my many instructions,
    they are considered like a stranger’s.

    13: 
They love sacrifice,
    they sacrifice meat and eat it,
    but the Lord is not pleased with them.
Now he will remember their guilt
    and punish their sins;
    they shall return to Egypt.

    14: 
Israel has forgotten his maker
    and has built palaces.
Judah, too, has fortified many cities,
    but I will send fire upon his cities,
    to devour their strongholds.
