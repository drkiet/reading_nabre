Day 216:

Reading Isaiah, chapters ['17', '18', '19', '20']:

  Chapter 17.

    1: 
Damascus
1 
    Oracle on Damascus:
See, Damascus shall cease to be a city
    and become a pile of ruins;

    2: 
Her cities shall be forever abandoned,
    for flocks to lie in undisturbed.

    3: 
The fortress shall vanish from Ephraim
    and dominion from Damascus;
The remnant of Aram shall become like the glory
    of the Israelites—
    oracle of the Lord of hosts.

    4: 
    On that day
The glory of Jacob shall fade,
    and his full body shall grow thin.

    5: 
Like the reaper’s mere armful of stalks,
    when he gathers the standing grain;
Or as when one gleans the ears
    in the Valley of Rephaim.

    6: 
    7: Damascus
1 
    Oracle on Damascus:
See, Damascus shall cease to be a city
    and become a pile of ruins;
2 
Her cities shall be forever abandoned,
    for flocks to lie in undisturbed.
3 
The fortress shall vanish from Ephraim[b]
    and dominion from Damascus;
The remnant of Aram shall become like the glory
    of the Israelites—
    oracle of the Lord of hosts.
4 
    On that day
The glory of Jacob shall fade,
    and his full body shall grow thin.
5 
Like the reaper’s mere armful of stalks,
    when he gathers the standing grain;
Or as when one gleans the ears
    in the Valley of Rephaim.[c]
6 
[d]Only gleanings shall be left in it,
    as when an olive tree has been beaten—
Two or three olives at the very top,
    four or five on its most fruitful branches—
    oracle of the Lord, the God of Israel.
7 
On that day people shall turn to their maker,
    their eyes shall look to the Holy One of Israel.

    8: 
They shall not turn to the altars, the work of their hands,
    nor shall they look to what their fingers have made:
    the asherahs or the incense stands.

    9: On that day his strong cities shall be
    like those abandoned by the Hivites and Amorites
When faced with the Israelites;
    and there shall be desolation.

    10: 
Truly, you have forgotten the God who saves you,
    the Rock, your refuge, you have not remembered.
Therefore, though you plant plants for the Pleasant One,
    and set out cuttings for a foreign one,

    11: 
Though you make them grow the day you plant them
    and make them blossom the morning you set them out,
The harvest shall disappear on a day of sickness
    and incurable pain.

    12: 
Ah! the roaring of many peoples—
    a roar like the roar of the seas!
The thundering of nations—
    thunder like the thundering of mighty waters!

    13: 
But God shall rebuke them,
    and they shall flee far away,
Driven like chaff on the mountains before a wind,
    like tumbleweed before a storm.

    14: 
At evening, there is terror,
    but before morning, they are gone!
Such is the portion of those who despoil us,
    the lot of those who plunder us.


  Chapter 18.

    1: 
Ethiopia
1 
Ah! Land of buzzing insects,
    beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,

    2: 
Sending ambassadors by sea,
    in papyrus boats on the waters!
Go, swift messengers,
    to a nation tall and bronzed,
To a people dreaded near and far,
    a nation strong and conquering,
    whose land is washed by rivers.

    3: 
All you who inhabit the world,
    who dwell on earth,
When the signal is raised on the mountain, look!
    When the trumpet blows, listen!

    4: 
For thus says the Lord to me:
    I will be quiet, looking on from where I dwell,
Like the shimmering heat in sunshine,
    like a cloud of dew at harvest time.

    5: 
Before the vintage, when the flowering has ended,
    and the blooms are succeeded by ripening grapes,
Then comes the cutting of branches with pruning hooks,
    and the discarding of the lopped-off shoots.

    6: 
They shall all be left to the mountain vultures
    and to the beasts of the earth;
The vultures shall summer on them,
    all the beasts of the earth shall winter on them.

    7: 
    8: Ethiopia
1 
Ah! Land of buzzing insects,
    beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,
2 
Sending ambassadors by sea,
    in papyrus boats on the waters!
Go, swift messengers,
    to a nation tall and bronzed,
To a people dreaded near and far,
    a nation strong and conquering,
    whose land is washed by rivers.
3 
[b]All you who inhabit the world,
    who dwell on earth,
When the signal is raised on the mountain, look!
    When the trumpet blows, listen!
4 
For thus says the Lord to me:
    I will be quiet, looking on from where I dwell,
Like the shimmering heat in sunshine,
    like a cloud of dew at harvest time.
5 
Before the vintage, when the flowering has ended,
    and the blooms are succeeded by ripening grapes,
Then comes the cutting of branches with pruning hooks,
    and the discarding of the lopped-off shoots.
6 
They shall all be left to the mountain vultures
    and to the beasts of the earth;
The vultures shall summer on them,
    all the beasts of the earth shall winter on them.
7 Then will gifts be brought to the Lord of hosts—to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, Mount Zion—from a people tall and bronzed, from a people dreaded near and far, a nation strong and conquering, whose land is washed by rivers.


  Chapter 19.

    1: 
Egypt
1 
    Oracle on Egypt:
See, the Lord is riding on a swift cloud
    on his way to Egypt;
The idols of Egypt tremble before him,
    the hearts of the Egyptians melt within them.

    2: 
I will stir up Egypt against Egypt:
    brother will war against brother,
Neighbor against neighbor,
    city against city, kingdom against kingdom.

    3: 
The courage of the Egyptians shall ebb away within them,
    and I will bring their counsel to nought;
They shall consult idols and charmers, ghosts and clairvoyants.

    4: 
I will deliver Egypt
    into the power of a cruel master,
A harsh king who shall rule over them—
    oracle of the Lord, the Lord of hosts.

    5: 
The waters shall be drained from the sea,
    the river shall parch and dry up;

    6: 
Its streams shall become foul,
    and the canals of Egypt shall dwindle and parch.
Reeds and rushes shall wither away,

    7: 
    and bulrushes on the bank of the Nile;
All the sown land along the Nile
    shall dry up and blow away, and be no more.

Utter fools are the princes of Zoan!
    the wisest of Pharaoh’s advisers give stupid counsel.

    12: 
Where then are your wise men?
    Let them tell you and make known
What the Lord of hosts has planned
    against Egypt.

    the princes of Memphis have been deceived.
The chiefs of its tribes

The Lord has prepared among them
    a spirit of dizziness,
And they have made Egypt stagger in whatever she does,
    as a drunkard staggers in his vomit.

Egypt shall accomplish nothing—
    neither head nor tail, palm branch nor reed, shall accomplish anything.

    16: On that day the Egyptians shall be like women, trembling with fear, because of the Lord of hosts shaking his fist at them. 
    17: And the land of Judah shall be a terror to the Egyptians. Every time they think of Judah, they shall stand in dread because of the plan the Lord of hosts has in mind for them.

16 On that day the Egyptians shall be like women, trembling with fear, because of the Lord of hosts shaking his fist at them. 17 And the land of Judah shall be a terror to the Egyptians. Every time they think of Judah, they shall stand in dread because of the plan the Lord of hosts has in mind for them.
18 On that day there shall be five cities[d] in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan and swear by the Lord of hosts; one shall be called “City of the Sun.”
19 On that day there shall be an altar to the Lord at the center of Egypt, and a sacred pillar to the Lord near its boundary. 
    20: This will be a sign and witness to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt, so that when they cry out to the Lord because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior to defend and deliver them. 
    21: The Lord shall make himself known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day; they shall offer sacrifices and oblations, make vows to the Lord and fulfill them. 
    22: Although the Lord shall smite Egypt severely, he shall heal them; they shall turn to the Lord and he shall be moved by their entreaty and heal them.

    23: On that day there shall be a highway from Egypt to Assyria; the Assyrians shall enter Egypt, and the Egyptians enter Assyria, and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians.

    24: On that day Israel shall be a third party with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth, 
    25: when the Lord of hosts gives this blessing: “Blessed be my people Egypt, and the work of my hands Assyria, and my heritage, Israel.”


  Chapter 20.

    1: 
    2: 
Isaiah’s Warning Against Trust in Egypt and Ethiopia. 1 In the year the general sent by Sargon, king of Assyria, came to Ashdod, fought against it, and captured it— 2 [b]at that time the Lord had spoken through Isaiah, the son of Amoz: Go and take off the sackcloth from your waist, and remove the sandals from your feet. This he did, walking naked and barefoot. 
    3: Then the Lord said: Just as my servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and portent against Egypt and Ethiopia, 
    4: so shall the king of Assyria lead away captives from Egypt, and exiles from Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, with buttocks uncovered, the shame of Egypt. 
    5: They shall be dismayed and ashamed because of Ethiopia, their hope, and because of Egypt, their boast. 
    6: The inhabitants of this coastland shall say on that day, “See what has happened to those we hoped in, to whom we fled for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! What escape is there for us now?”
