Thanksgiving After Sickness
1 For the leader. A psalm of David.
I
2 
Blessed the one concerned for the poor;[b]
    on a day of misfortune, the Lord delivers him.
3 
The Lord keeps and preserves him,
    makes him blessed in the land,
    and does not betray him to his enemies.
4 
The Lord sustains him on his sickbed,
    you turn down his bedding whenever he is ill.[c]
II

    5: 
Even I have said, “Lord, take note of me;
    heal me, although I have sinned against you.

    6: 
My enemies say bad things against me:
    ‘When will he die and his name be forgotten?’

    7: 
When someone comes to visit me, he speaks without sincerity.
    His heart stores up malice;
    when he leaves, he gossips.

    8: 
All those who hate me whisper together against me;
    they imagine the worst about me:

    9: ‘He has had ruin poured over him;
    that one lying down will never rise again.’

    10: 
Even my trusted friend,
    who ate my bread,
    has raised his heel against me.
III

    11: 
“But you, Lord, take note of me to raise me up
    that I may repay them.”

    12: 
By this I will know you are pleased with me,
    that my enemy no longer shouts in triumph over me.

    13: 
In my integrity may you support me
    and let me stand in your presence forever.

    14: 
Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
    from all eternity and forever.
    Amen. Amen.

    so my soul longs for you, O God.
3 
My soul thirsts for God, the living God.
    When can I enter and see the face of God?[c]
4 
My tears have been my bread day and night,
    as they ask me every day, “Where is your God?”

    5: 
Those times I recall
    as I pour out my soul,
When I would cross over to the shrine of the Mighty One,
    to the house of God,
Amid loud cries of thanksgiving,
    with the multitude keeping festival.

6 
Why are you downcast, my soul;
    why do you groan within me?
Wait for God, for I shall again praise him,
    my savior and my God.
II
7 
My soul is downcast within me;
    therefore I remember you
From the land of the Jordan[e] and Hermon,
    from Mount Mizar,

    8: 
Deep calls to deep
    in the roar of your torrents,
    and all your waves and breakers
    sweep over me.

    9: By day may the Lord send his mercy,
    and by night may his righteousness be with me!
    I will pray to the God of my life,

    10: 
I will say to God, my rock:
    “Why do you forget me?
Why must I go about mourning
    with the enemy oppressing me?”

    11: 
It shatters my bones, when my adversaries reproach me,
    when they say to me every day: “Where is your God?”

    12: 
Why are you downcast, my soul,
    why do you groan within me?
Wait for God, for I shall again praise him,
    my savior and my God.


  Chapter 43.

    1: 
Grant me justice, O God;
    defend me from a faithless people;
    from the deceitful and unjust rescue me.

    2: 
    3: 
    4: 
1 
Grant me justice, O God;
    defend me from a faithless people;
    from the deceitful and unjust rescue me.
2 
You, O God, are my strength.
    Why then do you spurn me?
Why must I go about mourning,
    with the enemy oppressing me?
3 
Send your light and your fidelity,
    that they may be my guide;
Let them bring me to your holy mountain,
    to the place of your dwelling,
4 
That I may come to the altar of God,
    to God, my joy, my delight.
Then I will praise you with the harp,
    O God, my God.

    5: 
Why are you downcast, my soul?
    Why do you groan within me?
Wait for God, for I shall again praise him,
    my savior and my God.


  Chapter 44.

    1: For the leader. A maskil of the Korahites.
I

    2: 
O God, we have heard with our own ears;
    our ancestors have told us
The deeds you did in their days,
    with your own hand in days of old:

    3: 
    4: 
God’s Past Favor and Israel’s Present Need
1 For the leader. A maskil of the Korahites.
I
2 
O God, we have heard with our own ears;
    our ancestors have told us
The deeds you did in their days,
    with your own hand in days of old:
3 
You rooted out nations to plant them,
    crushed peoples and expelled them.
4 
Not with their own swords did they conquer the land,
    nor did their own arms bring victory;
It was your right hand, your own arm,
    the light of your face for you favored them.

    5: 
You are my king and my God,
    who bestows victories on Jacob.

    6: 
Through you we batter our foes;
    through your name we trample our adversaries.

    7: 
Not in my bow do I trust,
    nor does my sword bring me victory.

    8: 
You have brought us victory over our enemies,
    shamed those who hate us.

    9: In God we have boasted all the day long;
    your name we will praise forever.
Selah
II

    10: 
But now you have rejected and disgraced us;
    you do not march out with our armies.

    11: 
You make us retreat before the foe;
    those who hate us plunder us at will.

    12: 
You hand us over like sheep to be slaughtered,
    scatter us among the nations.

    13: 
You sell your people for nothing;
    you make no profit from their sale.

    14: 
You make us the reproach of our neighbors,
    the mockery and scorn of those around us.

    15: 
You make us a byword among the nations;
    the peoples shake their heads at us.

    16: 
All day long my disgrace is before me;
    shame has covered my face

    17: 
At the sound of those who taunt and revile,
    at the sight of the enemy and avenger.
III

    18: 
All this has come upon us,
    though we have not forgotten you,
    nor been disloyal to your covenant.

    19: 
Our hearts have not turned back,
    nor have our steps strayed from your path.

    20: 
Yet you have left us crushed,
    desolate in a place of jackals;
    you have covered us with a shadow of death.

    21: 
If we had forgotten the name of our God,
    stretched out our hands to another god,

    22: 
Would not God have discovered this,
    God who knows the secrets of the heart?

    23: 
For you we are slain all the day long,
    considered only as sheep to be slaughtered.
IV

    24: 
Awake! Why do you sleep, O Lord?
    Rise up! Do not reject us forever!

    25: 
Why do you hide your face;
    why forget our pain and misery?

    26: 
For our soul has been humiliated in the dust;
    our belly is pressed to the earth.

    27: 
Rise up, help us!
    Redeem us in your mercy.
