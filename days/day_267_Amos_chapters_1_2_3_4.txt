Day 267:

Reading Amos, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: 1 The words of Amos, who was one of the sheepbreeders from Tekoa, which he received in a vision concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. 
    2: He said:
The Lord roars from Zion,
    and raises his voice from Jerusalem;
The pastures of the shepherds languish,
    and the summit of Carmel withers.
II. Oracles Against the Nations[c]
Aram

    3: Thus says the Lord:
For three crimes of Damascus, and now four—
    I will not take it back—
Because they threshed Gilead
    with sledges of iron,

    4: 
I will send fire upon the house of Hazael,
    and it will devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad.

    5: 
I will break the barred gate of Damascus;
    From the Valley of Aven I will cut off the one enthroned,
And the sceptered ruler from Beth-eden;
    the people of Aram shall be exiled to Kir, says the Lord.
Philistia

    6: Thus says the Lord:
For three crimes of Gaza, and now four—
    I will not take it back—
Because they exiled an entire population,
    handing them over to Edom,

    7: 
I will send fire upon the wall of Gaza,
    and it will devour its strongholds;

    8: 
From Ashdod I will cut off the one enthroned
    and the sceptered ruler from Ashkelon;
I will turn my hand against Ekron,
    and the last of the Philistines shall perish,
    says the Lord God.
Tyre

    9: hus says the Lord:
For three crimes of Tyre, and now four—
    I will not take it back—
Because they handed over an entire population to Edom,
    and did not remember their covenant of brotherhood,

    10: 
I will send fire upon the wall of Tyre,
    and it will devour its strongholds.
Edom

    11: Thus says the Lord:
For three crimes of Edom, and now four—
    I will not take it back—
Because he pursued his brother with the sword,
    suppressing all pity,
Persisting in his anger,
    his wrath raging without end,

    12: 
I will send fire upon Teman,
    and it will devour the strongholds of Bozrah.
Ammon

    13: Thus says the Lord:
For three crimes of the Ammonites, and now four—
    I will not take it back—
Because they ripped open pregnant women in Gilead,
    in order to extend their territory,

    14: 
I will kindle a fire upon the wall of Rabbah,
    and it will devour its strongholds
Amid war cries on the day of battle,
    amid stormwind on the day of tempest.

    15: 
Their king shall go into exile,
    he and his princes with him, says the Lord.


  Chapter 2.

    1: 
    2: Moab
1 Thus says the Lord:
For three crimes of Moab, and now four—
    I will not take it back—
Because he burned to ashes
    the bones of Edom’s king,
2 
I will send fire upon Moab,
    and it will devour the strongholds of Kerioth;
Moab shall meet death amid uproar,
    battle cries and blasts of the ram’s horn.

    3: 
I will cut off the ruler from its midst,
    and all the princes I will slay with him, says the Lord.
Judah

    4: Thus says the Lord:
For three crimes of Judah, and now four—
    I will not take it back—
Because they spurned the instruction of the Lord,
    and did not keep his statutes;
Because the lies[c] which their ancestors followed
    have led them astray,

    5: 
I will send fire upon Judah,
    and it will devour the strongholds of Jerusalem.
Israel

    6: Thus says the Lord:
For three crimes of Israel, and now four—
    I will not take it back—
Because they hand over the just for silver,
    and the poor for a pair of sandals;

    7: 
They trample the heads of the destitute
    into the dust of the earth,
    and force the lowly out of the way.
Son and father sleep with the same girl,
    profaning my holy name.

    8: 
Upon garments taken in pledge
    they recline beside any altar.
Wine at treasury expense
    they drink in their temples.

    9: Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorites before them,
    who were as tall as cedars,
    and as strong as oak trees.
I destroyed their fruit above
    and their roots beneath.

    10: 
It was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt,
    and who led you through the desert for forty years,
    to occupy the land of the Amorites;

    11: 
I who raised up prophets among your children,
    and nazirites among your young men.
Is this not so, Israelites?—
    oracle of the Lord.

    12: 
But you made the nazirites drink wine,
    and commanded the prophets, “Do not prophesy!”

    13: 
Look, I am groaning beneath you,
    as a wagon groans when laden with sheaves.

    14: 
Flight shall elude the swift,
    and the strong shall not retain strength;
The warrior shall not save his life,

    15: 
    nor shall the archer stand his ground;
The swift of foot shall not escape,
    nor shall the horseman save his life.

    16: 
And the most stouthearted of warriors
    shall flee naked on that day—
    oracle of the Lord.


  Chapter 3.

    1: 
Hear this word, Israelites, that the Lord speaks concerning you,
    concerning the whole family I brought up from the land of Egypt:

    2: 
    3: First Summons
1 
Hear this word, Israelites, that the Lord speaks concerning you,
    concerning the whole family I brought up from the land of Egypt:
2 
You alone I have known,
    among all the families of the earth;
Therefore I will punish you
    for all your iniquities.
3 
[b]Do two journey together
    unless they have agreed?

    4: 
Does a lion roar in the forest
    when it has no prey?
Does a young lion cry out from its den
    unless it has seized something?

    5: 
Does a bird swoop down on a trap on the ground
    when there is no lure for it?
Does a snare spring up from the ground
    without catching anything?

    6: 
Does the ram’s horn sound in a city
    without the people becoming frightened?
Does disaster befall a city
    unless the Lord has caused it?

    7: (Indeed, the Lord God does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.)

    8: 
The lion has roared,
    who would not fear?
The Lord God has spoken,
    who would not prophesy?

    9: Proclaim this in the strongholds of Assyria,
    in the strongholds of the land of Egypt:
“Gather on the mount of Samaria,
    and see the great disorders within it,
    the oppressions within its midst.”[d]

    10: 
They do not know how to do what is right—
    oracle of the Lord—
Storing up in their strongholds
    violence and destruction.

    11: 
Therefore thus says the Lord God:
An enemy shall surround the land,
    tear down your fortresses,
    and pillage your strongholds.

    12: 
Thus says the Lord:
As the shepherd rescues from the mouth of the lion
    a pair of sheep’s legs or the tip of an ear,
So shall the Israelites escape,
    those who dwell in Samaria,
With the corner of a couch
    or a piece of a cot.

    13: 
Hear and bear witness against the house of Jacob—
    an oracle of the Lord God, the God of hosts:

    14: 
On the day when I punish Israel for its crimes,
    I will also punish the altars of Bethel;
The horns of the altar shall be broken off
    and fall to the ground.

    15: 
I will strike the winter house
    and the summer house;
The houses of ivory shall lie in ruin,
    and their many rooms shall be no more—
    oracle of the Lord.


  Chapter 4.

    1: 
Hear this word, you cows of Bashan,
    who live on the mount of Samaria:
Who oppress the destitute
    and abuse the needy;
Who say to your husbands,
    “Bring us a drink!”

    2: 
The Lord God has sworn by his holiness:
Truly days are coming upon you
    when they shall drag you away with ropes,
    your children with fishhooks;

    3: 
    4: Second Summons
1 
Hear this word, you cows of Bashan,
    who live on the mount of Samaria:
Who oppress the destitute
    and abuse the needy;
Who say to your husbands,
    “Bring us a drink!”
2 
The Lord God has sworn by his holiness:
Truly days are coming upon you
    when they shall drag you away with ropes,
    your children with fishhooks;
3 
You shall go out through the breached walls
    one in front of the other,
And you shall be exiled to Harmon—[b]
    oracle of the Lord.
4 
Come to Bethel[c] and sin,
    to Gilgal and sin all the more!
Each morning bring your sacrifices,
    every third day your tithes;

    5: 
Burn leavened bread as a thanksgiving sacrifice,
    proclaim publicly your voluntary offerings,
For so you love to do, Israelites—
    oracle of the Lord God.

    6: 
Though I made your teeth
    clean of food in all your cities,
    and made bread scarce in all your dwellings,
Yet you did not return to me—
    oracle of the Lord.

    7: 
And I withheld the rain from you
    when the harvest was still three months away;
I sent rain upon one city
    but not upon another;
One field was watered by rain,
    but the one I did not water dried up;

    8: 
Two or three cities staggered to another to drink water
    but were not satisfied;
Yet you did not return to me—
    oracle of the Lord.

    9: I struck you with blight and mildew;
    locusts devoured your gardens and vineyards,
    the caterpillar consumed your fig trees and olive trees;
Yet you did not return to me—
    oracle of the Lord.

    10: 
I sent upon you pestilence like that of Egypt;
    with the sword I killed your young men and your captured horses,
    and to your nostrils I brought the stench of your camps;
Yet you did not return to me—
    oracle of the Lord.

    11: 
I overthrew you
    as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah;
    you were like a brand plucked from the fire,
Yet you did not return to me—
    oracle of the Lord.

    12: 
Therefore thus I will do to you, Israel:
    and since I will deal thus with you,
    prepare to meet your God, O Israel!

    13: 
The one who forms mountains and creates winds,
    and declares to mortals their thoughts;
Who makes dawn into darkness
    and strides upon the heights of the earth,
    the Lord, the God of hosts, is his name!
