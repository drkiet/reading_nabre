Day 231:

Reading Jeremiah, chapters ['9', '10', '11', '12']:

  Chapter 9.

    1: 
Oh, that I had in the wilderness
    a travelers’ lodging!
That I might leave my people
    and depart from them.
They are all adulterers,
    a band of traitors.

    2: 
They ready their tongues like a drawn bow;
    with lying, and not with truth,
    they are powerful in the land.
They go from evil to evil,
    and me they do not know—oracle of the Lord.

    3: 
Be on your guard, everyone against his neighbor;
    put no trust in any brother.
Every brother imitates Jacob, the supplanter,
    every neighbor is guilty of slander.

    4: 
Each one deceives the other,
    no one speaks the truth.
They have accustomed their tongues to lying,
    they are perverse and cannot repent.

    5: 
Violence upon violence,
    deceit upon deceit:
They refuse to know me—
    oracle of the Lord.

    6: 
Therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts:
I will refine them and test them;
    how else should I deal with the daughter of my people?

    7: 
A murderous arrow is their tongue,
    their mouths utter deceit;
They speak peaceably with their neighbors,
    but in their hearts they lay an ambush!

    8: 
    9: he Corruption of the People
1 
Oh, that I had in the wilderness
    a travelers’ lodging!
That I might leave my people
    and depart from them.
They are all adulterers,
    a band of traitors.
2 
They ready their tongues like a drawn bow;
    with lying, and not with truth,
    they are powerful in the land.
They go from evil to evil,
    and me they do not know—oracle of the Lord.
3 
Be on your guard, everyone against his neighbor;
    put no trust in any brother.
Every brother imitates Jacob, the supplanter,
    every neighbor is guilty of slander.
4 
Each one deceives the other,
    no one speaks the truth.
They have accustomed their tongues to lying,
    they are perverse and cannot repent.
5 
Violence upon violence,
    deceit upon deceit:
They refuse to know me—
    oracle of the Lord.
6 
Therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts:
I will refine them and test them;
    how else should I deal with the daughter of my people?
7 
A murderous arrow is their tongue,
    their mouths utter deceit;
They speak peaceably with their neighbors,
    but in their hearts they lay an ambush!
8 
Should I not punish them for these deeds—oracle of the Lord;
    on a nation such as this should I not take vengeance?
Dirge over the Ravaged Land
9 
Over the mountains I shall break out in cries of lamentation,
    over the pastures in the wilderness, in a dirge:
They are scorched, and no one crosses them,
    no sound of lowing cattle;
Birds of the air as well as beasts,
    all have fled and are gone.

    10: 
I will turn Jerusalem into a heap of ruins,
    a haunt of jackals;
The cities of Judah I will make a waste,
    where no one dwells.

    11: Who is wise enough to understand this? To whom has the mouth of the Lord spoken? Let him declare it!
Why is the land ravaged,
    scorched like a wilderness no one crosses?

    12: The Lord said: Because they have abandoned my law, which I set before them, and did not listen to me or follow it, 
    13: but followed instead their stubborn hearts and the Baals, as their ancestors had taught them, 
    14: therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: See now, I will give this people wormwood to eat and poisoned water to drink. 
    15: I will scatter them among nations whom neither they nor their ancestors have known; I will send the sword to pursue them until I have completely destroyed them.

    16: 
    Thus says the Lord of hosts:
Inquire, and call the wailing women to come;
    summon the most skilled of them.

    17: 
Let them come quickly
    and raise for us a dirge,
That our eyes may run with tears,
    our pupils flow with water.

    18: 
The sound of the dirge is heard from Zion:
    We are ruined and greatly ashamed;
We have left the land,
    given up our dwellings!

    19: 
Hear, you women, the word of the Lord,
    let your ears receive the word of his mouth.
Teach your daughters a dirge,
    and each other a lament:

    20: 
Death has come up through our windows,
    has entered our citadels,
To cut down children in the street,
    young people in the squares.

    21: 
Corpses shall fall
    like dung in the open field,
Like sheaves behind the harvester,
    with no one to gather them.
True Glory

    22: 
    Thus says the Lord:
Let not the wise boast of his wisdom,
    nor the strong boast of his strength,
    nor the rich man boast of his riches;

    23: 
But rather, let those who boast, boast of this,
    that in their prudence they know me,
Know that I, the Lord, act with fidelity,
    justice, and integrity on earth.
How I take delight in these—oracle of the Lord.
False Circumcision. 
    24: See, days are coming—oracle of the Lord—when I will demand an account of all those circumcised in the foreskin: 
    25: Egypt and Judah, Edom and the Ammonites, Moab, and those who live in the wilderness and shave their temples. For all the nations are uncircumcised, even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised at heart.


  Chapter 10.

    1: 
The Folly of Idolatry. 1 Hear the word the Lord speaks to you, house of Israel. 
    2: Thus says the Lord:
Do not learn the ways of the nations,
    and have no fear of the signs in the heavens,
    even though the nations fear them.

    3: 
For the carvings of the nations are nonentities,
    wood cut from the forest,
Fashioned by artisans with the adze,

    4: 
    adorned with silver and gold.
With nails and hammers they are fastened,
    so they do not fall.

    5: 
Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field are they,
    they cannot speak;
They must be carried about,
    for they cannot walk.
Do not fear them, they can do no harm,
    neither can they do good.

    6: 
No one is like you, Lord,
    you are great,
    great and mighty is your name.

    7: 
Who would not fear you,
    King of the nations,
    for it is your due!
Among all the wisest of the nations,
    and in all their domains,
    there is none like you.

    8: 
One and all they are stupid and senseless,
    the instruction from nonentities—only wood!

    9: 
    10: The Folly of Idolatry. 1 Hear the word the Lord speaks to you, house of Israel. 2 Thus says the Lord:
Do not learn the ways of the nations,
    and have no fear of the signs in the heavens,
    even though the nations fear them.
3 
For the carvings of the nations are nonentities,
    wood cut from the forest,
Fashioned by artisans with the adze,
4 
    adorned with silver and gold.
With nails and hammers they are fastened,
    so they do not fall.
5 
Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field are they,
    they cannot speak;
They must be carried about,
    for they cannot walk.
Do not fear them, they can do no harm,
    neither can they do good.
6 
No one is like you, Lord,
    you are great,
    great and mighty is your name.
7 
Who would not fear you,
    King of the nations,
    for it is your due!
Among all the wisest of the nations,
    and in all their domains,
    there is none like you.
8 
One and all they are stupid and senseless,
    the instruction from nonentities—only wood!
9 
Silver plates brought from Tarshish,
    and gold from Ophir,
The work of the artisan
    and the handiwork of the smelter,
Clothed with violet and purple—
    all of them the work of skilled workers.
10 
The Lord is truly God,
    he is the living God, the eternal King,
Before whose anger the earth quakes,
    whose wrath the nations cannot endure.

    11: Thus shall you say of them: The gods that did not make heaven and earth—let these perish from earth and from beneath heaven!

    12: 
The one who made the earth by his power,
    established the world by his wisdom,
    and by his skill stretched out the heavens.

    13: 
When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar,
    and he brings up clouds from the end of the earth,
Makes lightning flash in the rain,
    and brings forth the wind from his storehouses.

    14: 
Everyone is too stupid to know;
    every artisan is put to shame by his idol:
He has molded a fraud,
    without breath of life.

    15: 
They are nothing, objects of ridicule;
    they will perish in their time of punishment.

    16: 
Jacob’s portion is nothing like them:
    for he is the maker of everything!
Israel is his very own tribe,
    Lord of hosts is his name.
Abandonment of Judah

    17: 
Gather up your bundle from the land,
    City living under siege!

    18: 
    For thus says the Lord:
Now, at this time
    I will sling away the inhabitants of the land;
I will hem them in,
    that they may be taken.

    19: 
Woe is me! I am undone,
    my wound is beyond healing.
Yet I had thought:
    if I make light of my sickness, I can bear it.

    20: 
My tent is ruined,
    all its cords are severed.
My children have left me, they are no more:
    no one to pitch my tent,
    no one to raise its curtains.

    21: 
How stupid are the shepherds!
    The Lord they have not sought;
For this reason they have failed,
    and all their flocks scattered.

    22: 
Listen! a rumor! here it comes,
    a great commotion from the land of the north:
To make the cities of Judah a desolation,
    the haunt of jackals.
Prayer of Jeremiah

    23: 
I know, Lord,
    that no one chooses their way,
Nor determines their course
    nor directs their own step.

    24: 
Correct me, Lord, but with equity,
    not in anger, lest you diminish me.

    25: 
Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you,
    on the tribes that do not call your name;
For they have utterly devoured Jacob,
    and laid waste his home.


  Chapter 11.

    1: 
Plea for Fidelity to the Covenant. 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 
    2: Speak to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
    3: and say to them: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Cursed be anyone who does not observe the words of this covenant, 
    4: which I commanded your ancestors the day I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, that iron furnace, saying: Listen to my voice and do all that I command you. Then you shall be my people, and I will be your God. 
    5: Thus I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, the one you have today. “Amen, Lord,” I answered.

    6: Then the Lord said to me: Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and obey them. 
    7: I warned your ancestors unceasingly from the day I brought them up out of the land of Egypt even to this day: obey my voice. 
    8: But they did not listen or obey. They each walked in the stubbornness of their evil hearts, till I brought upon them all the threats of this covenant which they had failed to observe as I commanded them.

    9:  conspiracy has been found, the Lord said to me, among the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: 
    10: 
    11: Plea for Fidelity to the Covenant. 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 2 Speak to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 3 and say to them: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Cursed be anyone who does not observe the words of this covenant, 4 which I commanded your ancestors the day I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, that iron furnace, saying: Listen to my voice and do all that I command you. Then you shall be my people, and I will be your God. 5 Thus I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, the one you have today. “Amen, Lord,” I answered.
6 Then the Lord said to me: Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and obey them. 7 I warned your ancestors unceasingly from the day I brought them up out of the land of Egypt even to this day: obey my voice. 8 But they did not listen or obey. They each walked in the stubbornness of their evil hearts, till I brought upon them all the threats of this covenant which they had failed to observe as I commanded them.
9 A conspiracy has been found, the Lord said to me, among the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: 10 They have returned to the crimes of their ancestors who refused to obey my words. They also have followed and served other gods; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors. 11 Therefore, thus says the Lord: See, I am bringing upon them a disaster they cannot escape. Though they cry out to me, I will not listen to them. 
    12: Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they have been offering incense. But these gods will give them no help whatever in the time of their disaster.

    13: 
For as many as your cities
    are your gods, O Judah!
As many as the streets of Jerusalem
    are the altars for sacrifice to Baal.

    14: Now, you must not intercede for this people; do not raise on their behalf a cry or prayer! I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their disaster.
Sacrifices of No Avail

    15: 
What right has my beloved in my house,
    while she devises her plots?
Can vows and sacred meat turn away
    your disaster from you?
Will you still be jubilant

    16: 
    when you hear the great tumult?
The Lord has named you
    “a spreading olive tree, a pleasure to behold”;
Now he sets fire to it,
    its branches burn.

    17: The Lord of hosts who planted you has decreed disaster for you because of the evil done by the house of Israel and by the house of Judah, who provoked me by sacrificing to Baal.
The Plot Against Jeremiah. 
    18: I knew it because the Lord informed me: at that time you showed me their doings.

    19: Yet I was like a trusting lamb led to slaughter, not knowing that they were hatching plots against me: “Let us destroy the tree in its vigor; let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name will no longer be remembered.”

    20: 
But, you, Lord of hosts, just Judge,
    searcher of mind and heart,
Let me witness the vengeance you take on them,
    for to you I have entrusted my cause!

    21: Therefore, thus says the Lord concerning the men of Anathoth who seek your life and say, “Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord; otherwise you shall die by our hand.” 
    22: Therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts: I am going to punish them. The young men shall die by the sword; their sons and daughters shall die by famine. 
    23: None shall be spared among them, for I will bring disaster upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their punishment.

  Chapter 12.

    1: 
    2: 1 
You would be in the right, O Lord,
    if I should dispute with you;
    even so, I must lay out the case against you.
Why does the way of the wicked prosper,
    why do all the treacherous live in contentment?
2 
You planted them; they have taken root,
    they flourish and bear fruit as well.
You are upon their lips,
    but far from their thoughts.

    3: 
Lord, you know me, you see me,
    you have found that my heart is with you.
Pick them out like sheep for the butcher,
    set them apart for the day of slaughter.

    4: 
How long must the land mourn,
    the grass of the whole countryside wither?
Because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it
    beasts and birds disappear,
    for they say, “God does not care about our future.”

    5: 
If running against men has wearied you,
    how will you race against horses?
And if you are safe only on a level stretch,
    what will you do in the jungle of the Jordan?

    6: Your kindred and your father’s house, even they betray you; they have recruited a force against you. Do not believe them, even when they speak fair words to you.
The Lord’s Complaint

    7: 
I have abandoned my house,
    cast off my heritage;
The beloved of my soul I have delivered
    into the hand of her foes.

    8: 
My heritage has become for me
    like a lion in the thicket;
She has raised her voice against me,
    therefore she has incurred my hatred.

    9: My heritage is a prey for hyenas,
    is surrounded by vultures;
Come, gather together, all you wild animals,
    come and eat!

    10: 
Many shepherds have ravaged my vineyard,
    have trampled down my heritage;
My delightful portion they have turned
    into a desert waste.

    11: 
    12: 1 
You would be in the right, O Lord,
    if I should dispute with you;
    even so, I must lay out the case against you.
Why does the way of the wicked prosper,
    why do all the treacherous live in contentment?
2 
You planted them; they have taken root,
    they flourish and bear fruit as well.
You are upon their lips,
    but far from their thoughts.
3 
Lord, you know me, you see me,
    you have found that my heart is with you.
Pick them out like sheep for the butcher,
    set them apart for the day of slaughter.
4 
How long must the land mourn,
    the grass of the whole countryside wither?
Because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it
    beasts and birds disappear,
    for they say, “God does not care about our future.”
5 
If running against men has wearied you,
    how will you race against horses?
And if you are safe only on a level stretch,
    what will you do in the jungle of the Jordan?
6 Your kindred and your father’s house, even they betray you; they have recruited a force against you. Do not believe them, even when they speak fair words to you.
The Lord’s Complaint
7 
I have abandoned my house,
    cast off my heritage;
The beloved of my soul I have delivered
    into the hand of her foes.
8 
My heritage has become for me
    like a lion in the thicket;
She has raised her voice against me,
    therefore she has incurred my hatred.
9 
My heritage is a prey for hyenas,
    is surrounded by vultures;
Come, gather together, all you wild animals,
    come and eat!
10 
Many shepherds have ravaged my vineyard,
    have trampled down my heritage;
My delightful portion they have turned
    into a desert waste.
11 
They have made it a mournful waste,
    desolate before me,
Desolate, the whole land,
    because no one takes it to heart.
12 
Upon every height in the wilderness
    marauders have appeared.
The Lord has a sword that consumes
    the land from end to end:
    no peace for any living thing.

    13: 
They have sown wheat and reaped thorns,
    they have tired themselves out for no purpose;
They are shamed by their harvest,
    the burning anger of the Lord.
Judah’s Neighbors. 
    14: Thus says the Lord, against all my evil neighbors who plunder the heritage I gave my people Israel as their own: See, I will uproot them from their land; the house of Judah I will uproot in their midst.

    15: But after uprooting them, I will have compassion on them again and bring them back, each to their heritage, each to their land. 
    16: And if they truly learn my people’s custom of swearing by my name, “As the Lord lives,” just as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they shall be built up in the midst of my people. 
    17: But if they do not obey, I will uproot and destroy that nation entirely—oracle of the Lord.
