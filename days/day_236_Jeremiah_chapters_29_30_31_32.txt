Day 236:

Reading Jeremiah, chapters ['29', '30', '31', '32']:

  Chapter 29.

    1: 
    2: 
Letter to the Exiles in Babylon. 1 These are the words of the scroll which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remaining elders among the exiles, to the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon. 2 This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the court officials, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the artisans and smiths had left Jerusalem. 
    3: Delivered in Babylon by Elasah, son of Shaphan, and by Gemariah, son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah, king of Judah, sent to the king of Babylon, the letter read:

    4: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon: 
    5: Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their fruits. 
    6: Take wives and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters. Increase there; do not decrease. 
    7: Seek the welfare of the city to which I have exiled you; pray for it to the Lord, for upon its welfare your own depends. 
    8: 
    9: etter to the Exiles in Babylon. 1 These are the words of the scroll which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remaining elders among the exiles, to the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon. 2 This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the court officials, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the artisans and smiths had left Jerusalem. 3 Delivered in Babylon by Elasah, son of Shaphan, and by Gemariah, son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah, king of Judah, sent to the king of Babylon, the letter read:
4 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon: 5 Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their fruits. 6 Take wives and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters. Increase there; do not decrease. 7 Seek the welfare of the city to which I have exiled you; pray for it to the Lord, for upon its welfare your own depends. 8 For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not be deceived by the prophets and diviners who are among you; do not listen to those among you who dream dreams, 9 for they prophesy lies to you in my name; I did not send them—oracle of the Lord.

    10: For thus says the Lord: Only after seventy years have elapsed for Babylon will I deal with you and fulfill for you my promise to bring you back to this place. 
    11: For I know well the plans I have in mind for you—oracle of the Lord—plans for your welfare and not for woe, so as to give you a future of hope. 
    12: When you call me, and come and pray to me, I will listen to you. 
    13: When you look for me, you will find me. Yes, when you seek me with all your heart, 
    14: I will let you find me—oracle of the Lord—and I will change your lot; I will gather you together from all the nations and all the places to which I have banished you—oracle of the Lord—and bring you back to the place from which I have exiled you. 
    15: As for your saying, “The Lord has raised up for us prophets here in Babylon”—

    16: Thus says the Lord concerning the king sitting on David’s throne and all the people living in this city, your kinsmen who did not go with you into exile; 
    17: thus says the Lord of hosts: I am sending against them sword, famine, and pestilence. I will make them like rotten figs, so spoiled that they cannot be eaten. 
    18: I will pursue them with sword, famine, and pestilence, and make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse, a desolation, a hissing, and a reproach to all the nations among which I have banished them, 
    19: because they did not listen to my words—oracle of the Lord—even though I kept sending them my servants the prophets, but they would not listen to them—oracle of the Lord.

    20: As for you, listen to the word of the Lord, all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
    21: This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says about Ahab, son of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah, son of Maaseiah, who prophesy lies to you in my name: I am handing them over to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who will kill them before your eyes. 
    22: And because of them this curse will be used by all the exiles of Judah in Babylon: “May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in fire,” 
    23: because they have committed an outrage in Israel, committing adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and alleging in my name things I did not command. I know, I am witness—oracle of the Lord.
The False Prophet Shemaiah. 
    24: To Shemaiah, the Nehelamite, say: 
    25: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you sent documents in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to Zephaniah, the priest, son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests saying: 
    26: “It is the Lord who has appointed you priest in place of the priest Jehoiada, to provide officers for the house of the Lord, that you may confine in stocks or pillory any madman who poses as a prophet. 
    27: Why, then, have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who poses as a prophet among you? 
    28: 
    29: Letter to the Exiles in Babylon. 1 These are the words of the scroll which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remaining elders among the exiles, to the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon. 2 This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the court officials, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the artisans and smiths had left Jerusalem. 3 Delivered in Babylon by Elasah, son of Shaphan, and by Gemariah, son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah, king of Judah, sent to the king of Babylon, the letter read:
4 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon: 5 Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their fruits. 6 Take wives and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters. Increase there; do not decrease. 7 Seek the welfare of the city to which I have exiled you; pray for it to the Lord, for upon its welfare your own depends. 8 For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not be deceived by the prophets and diviners who are among you; do not listen to those among you who dream dreams, 9 for they prophesy lies to you in my name; I did not send them—oracle of the Lord.
10 For thus says the Lord: Only after seventy years have elapsed for Babylon will I deal with you and fulfill for you my promise to bring you back to this place. 11 For I know well the plans I have in mind for you—oracle of the Lord—plans for your welfare and not for woe, so as to give you a future of hope. 12 When you call me, and come and pray to me, I will listen to you. 13 When you look for me, you will find me. Yes, when you seek me with all your heart, 14 I will let you find me—oracle of the Lord—and I will change your lot; I will gather you together from all the nations and all the places to which I have banished you—oracle of the Lord—and bring you back to the place from which I have exiled you. 15 As for your saying, “The Lord has raised up for us prophets here in Babylon”—
16 Thus says the Lord concerning the king sitting on David’s throne and all the people living in this city, your kinsmen who did not go with you into exile; 17 thus says the Lord of hosts: I am sending against them sword, famine, and pestilence. I will make them like rotten figs, so spoiled that they cannot be eaten. 18 I will pursue them with sword, famine, and pestilence, and make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse, a desolation, a hissing, and a reproach to all the nations among which I have banished them, 19 because they did not listen to my words—oracle of the Lord—even though I kept sending them my servants the prophets, but they would not listen to them—oracle of the Lord.
20 As for you, listen to the word of the Lord, all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. 21 This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says about Ahab, son of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah, son of Maaseiah, who prophesy lies to you in my name: I am handing them over to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who will kill them before your eyes. 22 And because of them this curse will be used by all the exiles of Judah in Babylon: “May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in fire,” 23 because they have committed an outrage in Israel, committing adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and alleging in my name things I did not command. I know, I am witness—oracle of the Lord.
The False Prophet Shemaiah. 24 To Shemaiah, the Nehelamite, say: 25 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you sent documents in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to Zephaniah, the priest, son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests saying: 26 [b]“It is the Lord who has appointed you priest in place of the priest Jehoiada, to provide officers for the house of the Lord, that you may confine in stocks or pillory any madman who poses as a prophet. 27 Why, then, have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who poses as a prophet among you? 28 For he sent this message to us in Babylon: It will be a long time; build houses to live in; plant gardens and eat their fruit. . . .”
29 When the priest Zephaniah read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet, 
    30: the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 
    31: Send to all the exiles: Thus says the Lord concerning Shemaiah, the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah prophesies to you, although I did not send him, and has led you to rely on a lie, 
    32: therefore thus says the Lord, I will punish Shemaiah, the Nehelamite, and his descendants. None of them shall dwell among this people to see the good I will do for this people—oracle of the Lord—because he preached rebellion against the Lord.


  Chapter 30.

    1: This word came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 
    2: 
    3: 
The Restoration. 1 This word came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 2 Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Write down on a scroll all the words I have spoken to you. 3 For indeed, the days are coming—oracle of the Lord—when I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel and Judah—oracle of the Lord. I will bring them back to the land which I gave to their ancestors, and they shall take possession of it.

    4: These are the words the Lord spoke to Israel and to Judah: 
    5: Thus says the Lord:
We hear a cry of fear:
    terror, not peace.

    6: 
Inquire and see:
    does a male give birth?
Why, then, do I see all these men,
    their hands on their loins
Like women in labor,
    all their faces drained of color?

    7: 
Ah! How mighty is that day—
    there is none like it!
A time of distress for Jacob,
    though he shall be saved from it.

    8: On that day—oracle of the Lord of hosts—I will break his yoke off your neck and snap your bonds. Strangers shall no longer enslave them; 
    9: nstead, they shall serve the Lord, their God, and David, their king, whom I will raise up for them.

    10: 
But you, my servant Jacob, do not fear!—oracle of the Lord—
    do not be dismayed, Israel!
For I will soon deliver you from places far away,
    your offspring from the land of their exile;
Jacob shall again find rest,
    secure, with none to frighten him,

    11: 
    for I am with you—oracle of the Lord—to save you.
I will bring to an end all the nations
    among whom I have scattered you;
    but you I will not bring to an end.
I will chastise you as you deserve,
    I will not let you go unpunished.

    12: 
    For thus says the Lord:
Incurable is your wound,
    grievous your injury;

    13: 
There is none to plead your case,
    no remedy for your running sore,
    no healing for you.

    14: 
All your lovers have forgotten you,
    they do not seek you out.
I struck you as an enemy would strike,
    punishing you cruelly.

    15: 
Why cry out over your wound?
    There is no relief for your pain.
Because of your great guilt,
    your numerous sins,
    I have done this to you.

    16: 
Yet all who devour you shall be devoured,
    all your enemies shall go into exile.
All who plunder you shall become plunder,
    all who pillage you I will hand over to be pillaged.

    17: 
For I will restore your health;
    I will heal your injuries—oracle of the Lord.
“The outcast” they have called you,
    “whom no one looks for.”

    18: 
    Thus says the Lord:
See! I will restore the fortunes of Jacob’s tents,
    on his dwellings I will have compassion;
A city shall be rebuilt upon its own ruins,
    a citadel restored where it should be.

    19: 
From them will come praise,
    the sound of people rejoicing.
I will increase them, they will not decrease,
    I will glorify them, they will not be insignificant.

    20: 
His children shall be as of old,
    his assembly shall stand firm in my presence,
    I will punish all his oppressors.

    21: 
His leader shall be one of his own,
    and his ruler shall emerge from his ranks.
He shall approach me when I summon him;
    Why else would he dare
    approach me?—oracle of the Lord.

    22: 
You shall be my people,
    and I will be your God.

    23: 
Look! The storm of the Lord!
    His wrath breaks out
In a whirling storm
    that bursts upon the heads of the wicked.

    24: 
The anger of the Lord will not abate
    until he has carried out completely
    the decisions of his heart.
In days to come
    you will fully understand it.


  Chapter 31.

    1: Good News of the Return
1 
At that time—oracle of the Lord—
    I will be the God of all the families of Israel,
    and they shall be my people.

    2: 
    3: 
Good News of the Return
1 
At that time—oracle of the Lord—
    I will be the God of all the families of Israel,
    and they shall be my people.
2 
    Thus says the Lord:
The people who escaped the sword
    find favor in the wilderness.
As Israel comes forward to receive rest,
3 
    from afar the Lord appears:
With age-old love I have loved you;
    so I have kept my mercy toward you.

    4: 
Again I will build you, and you shall stay built,
    virgin Israel;
Carrying your festive tambourines,
    you shall go forth dancing with merrymakers.

    5: 
You shall again plant vineyards
    on the mountains of Samaria;
    those who plant them shall enjoy their fruits.

    6: 
Yes, a day will come when the watchmen
    call out on Mount Ephraim:
“Come, let us go up to Zion,
    to the Lord, our God.”
The Road of Return

    7: 
    For thus says the Lord:
Shout with joy for Jacob,
    exult at the head of the nations;
    proclaim your praise and say:
The Lord has saved his people,
    the remnant of Israel.

    8: 
Look! I will bring them back
    from the land of the north;
I will gather them from the ends of the earth,
    the blind and the lame in their midst,
Pregnant women, together with those in labor—
    an immense throng—they shall return.

    9: With weeping they shall come,
    but with compassion I will guide them;
I will lead them to streams of water,
    on a level road, without stumbling.
For I am a father to Israel,
    Ephraim is my firstborn.

    10: 
Hear the word of the Lord, you nations,
    proclaim it on distant coasts, and say:
The One who scattered Israel, now gathers them;
    he guards them as a shepherd his flock.

    11: 
The Lord shall ransom Jacob,
    he shall redeem him from a hand too strong for him.

    12: 
Shouting, they shall mount the heights of Zion,
    they shall come streaming to the Lord’s blessings:
The grain, the wine, and the oil,
    flocks of sheep and cattle;
They themselves shall be like watered gardens,
    never again neglected.

    13: 
Then young women shall make merry and dance,
    young men and old as well.
I will turn their mourning into joy,
    I will show them compassion and have them rejoice after their sorrows.

    14: 
I will lavish choice portions on the priests,
    and my people shall be filled with my blessings—
    oracle of the Lord.
End of Rachel’s Mourning

    15: 
    Thus says the Lord:
In Ramah is heard the sound of sobbing,
    bitter weeping!
Rachel mourns for her children,
    she refuses to be consoled
    for her children—they are no more!

    16: 
    Thus says the Lord:
Cease your cries of weeping,
    hold back your tears!
There is compensation for your labor—
    oracle of the Lord—
    they shall return from the enemy’s land.

    17: 
There is hope for your future—oracle of the Lord—
    your children shall return to their own territory.

    18: 
Indeed, I heard Ephraim rocking in grief:
    You chastised me, and I was chastised;
    I was like an untamed calf.
Bring me back, let me come back,
    for you are the Lord, my God.

    19: 
For after I turned away, I repented;
    after I came to myself, I struck my thigh;
I was ashamed, even humiliated,
    because I bore the disgrace of my youth.

    20: 
Is Ephraim not my favored son,
    the child in whom I delight?
Even though I threaten him,
    I must still remember him!
My heart stirs for him,
    I must show him compassion!—oracle of the Lord.
Summons to Return Home

    21: 
Set up road markers,
    put up signposts;
Turn your attention to the highway,
    the road you walked.
Turn back, virgin Israel,
    turn back to these your cities.

    22: 
How long will you continue to hesitate,
    rebellious daughter?
The Lord has created a new thing upon the earth:
    woman encompasses man.

    23: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: When I restore their fortunes in the land of Judah and in its cities, they shall again use this greeting: “May the Lord bless you, Tent of Justice, Holy Mountain!” 
    24: Judah and all its cities, the farmers and those who lead the flock shall dwell there together. 
    25: For I will slake the thirst of the faint; the appetite of all the weary I will satisfy. 
    26: At this I awoke and opened my eyes; my sleep was satisfying.

    27: See, days are coming—oracle of the Lord—when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of human beings and the seed of animals. 
    28: As I once watched over them to uproot and tear down, to demolish, to destroy, and to harm, so I will watch over them to build and to plant—oracle of the Lord. 
    29: In those days they shall no longer say,
“The parents ate unripe grapes,
    and the children’s teeth are set on edge,”

    30: 
    31: Good News of the Return
1 
At that time—oracle of the Lord—
    I will be the God of all the families of Israel,
    and they shall be my people.
2 
    Thus says the Lord:
The people who escaped the sword
    find favor in the wilderness.
As Israel comes forward to receive rest,
3 
    from afar the Lord appears:
With age-old love I have loved you;
    so I have kept my mercy toward you.
4 
Again I will build you, and you shall stay built,
    virgin Israel;
Carrying your festive tambourines,
    you shall go forth dancing with merrymakers.
5 
You shall again plant vineyards
    on the mountains of Samaria;
    those who plant them shall enjoy their fruits.
6 
Yes, a day will come when the watchmen
    call out on Mount Ephraim:
“Come, let us go up to Zion,
    to the Lord, our God.”
The Road of Return
7 
    For thus says the Lord:
Shout with joy for Jacob,
    exult at the head of the nations;
    proclaim your praise and say:
The Lord has saved his people,
    the remnant of Israel.
8 
Look! I will bring them back
    from the land of the north;
I will gather them from the ends of the earth,
    the blind and the lame in their midst,
Pregnant women, together with those in labor—
    an immense throng—they shall return.
9 
With weeping they shall come,
    but with compassion I will guide them;
I will lead them to streams of water,
    on a level road, without stumbling.
For I am a father to Israel,
    Ephraim is my firstborn.
10 
Hear the word of the Lord, you nations,
    proclaim it on distant coasts, and say:
The One who scattered Israel, now gathers them;
    he guards them as a shepherd his flock.
11 
The Lord shall ransom Jacob,
    he shall redeem him from a hand too strong for him.
12 
Shouting, they shall mount the heights of Zion,
    they shall come streaming to the Lord’s blessings:
The grain, the wine, and the oil,
    flocks of sheep and cattle;
They themselves shall be like watered gardens,
    never again neglected.
13 
Then young women shall make merry and dance,
    young men and old as well.
I will turn their mourning into joy,
    I will show them compassion and have them rejoice after their sorrows.
14 
I will lavish choice portions on the priests,
    and my people shall be filled with my blessings—
    oracle of the Lord.
End of Rachel’s Mourning
15 
    Thus says the Lord:
In Ramah[b] is heard the sound of sobbing,
    bitter weeping!
Rachel mourns for her children,
    she refuses to be consoled
    for her children—they are no more!
16 
    Thus says the Lord:
Cease your cries of weeping,
    hold back your tears!
There is compensation for your labor—
    oracle of the Lord—
    they shall return from the enemy’s land.
17 
There is hope for your future—oracle of the Lord—
    your children shall return to their own territory.
18 
Indeed, I heard Ephraim rocking in grief:
    You chastised me, and I was chastised;
    I was like an untamed calf.
Bring me back, let me come back,
    for you are the Lord, my God.
19 
For after I turned away, I repented;
    after I came to myself, I struck my thigh;[c]
I was ashamed, even humiliated,
    because I bore the disgrace of my youth.
20 
Is Ephraim not my favored son,
    the child in whom I delight?
Even though I threaten him,
    I must still remember him!
My heart stirs for him,
    I must show him compassion!—oracle of the Lord.
Summons to Return Home
21 
Set up road markers,
    put up signposts;
Turn your attention to the highway,
    the road you walked.
Turn back, virgin Israel,
    turn back to these your cities.
22 
How long will you continue to hesitate,
    rebellious daughter?
The Lord has created a new thing upon the earth:
    woman encompasses man.[d]
23 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: When I restore their fortunes in the land of Judah and in its cities, they shall again use this greeting: “May the Lord bless you, Tent of Justice, Holy Mountain!” 24 Judah and all its cities, the farmers and those who lead the flock shall dwell there together. 25 For I will slake the thirst of the faint; the appetite of all the weary I will satisfy. 26 At this I awoke and opened my eyes; my sleep was satisfying.[e]
27 See, days are coming—oracle of the Lord—when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of human beings and the seed of animals. 28 As I once watched over them to uproot and tear down, to demolish, to destroy, and to harm, so I will watch over them to build and to plant—oracle of the Lord. 29 In those days they shall no longer say,
“The parents ate unripe grapes,
    and the children’s teeth are set on edge,”[f]
30 but all shall die because of their own iniquity: the teeth of anyone who eats unripe grapes shall be set on edge.
The New Covenant.[g] 31 See, days are coming—oracle of the Lord—when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. 
    32: It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. They broke my covenant, though I was their master—oracle of the Lord. 
    33: But this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days—oracle of the Lord. I will place my law within them, and write it upon their hearts; I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
    34: They will no longer teach their friends and relatives, “Know the Lord!” Everyone, from least to greatest, shall know me—oracle of the Lord—for I will forgive their iniquity and no longer remember their sin.
Certainty of God’s Promise

    35: 
    Thus says the Lord,
Who gives the sun to light the day,
    moon and stars to light the night;
Who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar,
    whose name is Lord of hosts:

    36: 
If ever this fixed order gives way
    before me—oracle of the Lord—
Then would the offspring of Israel cease
    as a people before me forever.

    37: 
    Thus says the Lord:
If the heavens on high could be measured,
    or the foundations below the earth be explored,
Then would I reject all the offspring of Israel
    because of all they have done—oracle of the Lord.
Jerusalem Rebuilt. 
    38: See, days are coming—oracle of the Lord—when the city shall be rebuilt as the Lord’s, from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. 
    39: A measuring line shall be stretched from there straight to the hill Gareb and then turn to Goah. 
    40: The whole valley of corpses and ashes, all the terraced slopes toward the Wadi Kidron, as far as the corner of the Horse Gate at the east, shall be holy to the Lord. Never again shall the city be uprooted or demolished.


  Chapter 32.

    1: 
    2: 
    3: 
Pledge of Restoration. 1 The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah,[b] king of Judah, the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. 2 At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, while Jeremiah the prophet was confined to the court of the guard, in the house of the king of Judah. 3 Zedekiah, king of Judah, had confined him there, saying: “How dare you prophesy: Thus says the Lord: I am handing this city over to the king of Babylon that he may capture it. 
    4: Zedekiah, king of Judah, shall not escape the hands of the Chaldeans: he shall indeed be handed over to the king of Babylon. He shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye. 
    5: He shall take Zedekiah to Babylon. There he shall remain, until I attend to him—oracle of the Lord. If you fight against the Chaldeans, you cannot win!”

    6: Jeremiah said, This word came to me from the Lord: 
    7: Hanamel, son of your uncle Shallum, will come to you with the offer: “Purchase my field in Anathoth, since you, as nearest relative, have the first right of purchase.” 
    8: And, just as the Lord had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the court of the guard and said, “Please purchase my field in Anathoth, in the territory of Benjamin; as nearest relative, you have the first right of possession—purchase it for yourself.” Then I knew this was the word of the Lord. 
    9: o I bought the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, weighing out for him the silver, seventeen shekels of silver.

    10: When I had written and sealed the deed, called witnesses and weighed out the silver on the scales, 
    11: I accepted the deed of purchase, both the sealed copy, containing title and conditions, and the open copy. 
    12: I gave this deed of purchase to Baruch, son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and the witnesses who had signed the deed of purchase and before all the Judahites sitting around in the court of the guard.

    13: In their presence I gave Baruch this charge: 
    14: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds of purchase, both the sealed and the open deeds, and put them in an earthenware jar, so they can last a long time. 
    15: For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: They shall again purchase houses and fields and vineyards in this land.

    16: After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch, son of Neriah, I prayed to the Lord: 
    17: Ah, my Lord God! You made the heavens and the earth with your great power and your outstretched arm; nothing is too difficult for you. 
    18: You continue your kindness through a thousand generations; but you repay the ancestors’ guilt upon their children who follow them. Great and mighty God, whose name is Lord of hosts, 
    19: great in counsel, mighty in deed, whose eyes are fixed on all the ways of mortals, giving to all according to their ways, according to the fruit of their deeds: 
    20: you performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt and to this day, in Israel and among all peoples, you have made a name for yourself as on this day. 
    21: You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and great terror. 
    22: And you gave them this land, as you had sworn to their ancestors to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
    23: They went in and took possession of it, but they did not listen to your voice. They did not live by your law; they did not do anything you commanded them to do. Then you made all this evil fall upon them. 
    24: See, the siegeworks have arrived at this city to capture it; the city is handed over to the Chaldeans who are attacking it, with sword, starvation, and disease. What you threatened has happened—you can see it for yourself. 
    25: Yet you told me, my Lord God: Purchase the field with silver and summon witnesses, when the city has already been handed over to the Chaldeans!

    26: Then this word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 
    27: I am the Lord, the God of all the living! Is anything too difficult for me? 
    28: Therefore the Lord says: I am handing over this city to the Chaldeans and to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and he shall capture it. 
    29: The Chaldeans who are attacking this city shall go in and set the city on fire, burning it and the houses, on whose roofs incense was burned to Baal and libations were poured out to other gods in order to provoke me. 
    30: From their youth the Israelites and the Judahites have been doing only what is evil in my eyes; the Israelites have been provoking me with the works of their hands—oracle of the Lord. 
    31: 
    32: Pledge of Restoration. 1 The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah,[b] king of Judah, the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. 2 At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, while Jeremiah the prophet was confined to the court of the guard, in the house of the king of Judah. 3 Zedekiah, king of Judah, had confined him there, saying: “How dare you prophesy: Thus says the Lord: I am handing this city over to the king of Babylon that he may capture it. 4 Zedekiah, king of Judah, shall not escape the hands of the Chaldeans: he shall indeed be handed over to the king of Babylon. He shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye. 5 He shall take Zedekiah to Babylon. There he shall remain, until I attend to him—oracle of the Lord. If you fight against the Chaldeans, you cannot win!”
6 [c]Jeremiah said, This word came to me from the Lord: 7 Hanamel, son of your uncle Shallum, will come to you with the offer: “Purchase my field in Anathoth, since you, as nearest relative, have the first right of purchase.”[d] 8 And, just as the Lord had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the court of the guard and said, “Please purchase my field in Anathoth, in the territory of Benjamin; as nearest relative, you have the first right of possession—purchase it for yourself.” Then I knew this was the word of the Lord. 9 So I bought the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, weighing out for him the silver, seventeen shekels of silver.
10 When I had written and sealed the deed, called witnesses and weighed out the silver on the scales, 11 I accepted the deed of purchase, both the sealed copy, containing title and conditions, and the open copy.[e] 12 I gave this deed of purchase to Baruch, son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and the witnesses who had signed the deed of purchase and before all the Judahites sitting around in the court of the guard.
13 In their presence I gave Baruch this charge: 14 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds of purchase, both the sealed and the open deeds, and put them in an earthenware jar,[f] so they can last a long time. 15 For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: They shall again purchase houses and fields and vineyards in this land.
16 After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch, son of Neriah, I prayed to the Lord: 17 Ah, my Lord God! You made the heavens and the earth with your great power and your outstretched arm; nothing is too difficult for you. 18 You continue your kindness through a thousand generations; but you repay the ancestors’ guilt upon their children who follow them. Great and mighty God, whose name is Lord of hosts, 19 great in counsel, mighty in deed, whose eyes are fixed on all the ways of mortals, giving to all according to their ways, according to the fruit of their deeds: 20 you performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt and to this day, in Israel and among all peoples, you have made a name for yourself as on this day. 21 You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and great terror. 22 And you gave them this land, as you had sworn to their ancestors to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. 23 They went in and took possession of it, but they did not listen to your voice. They did not live by your law; they did not do anything you commanded them to do. Then you made all this evil fall upon them. 24 See, the siegeworks have arrived at this city to capture it; the city is handed over to the Chaldeans who are attacking it, with sword, starvation, and disease. What you threatened has happened—you can see it for yourself. 25 Yet you told me, my Lord God: Purchase the field with silver and summon witnesses, when the city has already been handed over to the Chaldeans!
26 Then this word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 27 I am the Lord, the God of all the living! Is anything too difficult for me? 28 Therefore the Lord says: I am handing over this city to the Chaldeans and to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and he shall capture it. 29 The Chaldeans who are attacking this city shall go in and set the city on fire, burning it and the houses, on whose roofs incense was burned to Baal and libations were poured out to other gods in order to provoke me. 30 From their youth the Israelites and the Judahites have been doing only what is evil in my eyes; the Israelites have been provoking me with the works of their hands—oracle of the Lord. 31 This city has so stirred my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to this day, that I must put it out of my sight, 32 for all the evil the Israelites and Judahites have done to provoke me—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
    33: They turned their backs to me, not their faces; though I taught them persistently, they would not listen or accept correction. 
    34: Instead they set up their abominations in the house which bears my name in order to defile it. 
    35: They built high places to Baal in the Valley of Ben-hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech; I never commanded them to do this, nor did it even enter my mind that they would practice this abomination, so as to bring sin upon Judah.

    36: Now, therefore, thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this city, which you say is being handed over to the king of Babylon by means of the sword, starvation, and disease: 
    37: See, I am gathering them from all the lands to which I drove them in my rising fury and great anger; I will bring them back to this place and settle them here in safety. 
    38: They shall be my people, and I will be their God. 
    39: I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me always, for their own good and the good of their children after them. 
    40: With them I will make an everlasting covenant, never to cease doing good to them; I will put fear of me in their hearts so that they never turn away from me. 
    41: I will take delight in doing good to them: I will plant them firmly in this land, with all my heart and soul.

    42: For thus says the Lord: Just as I have brought upon this people all this great evil, so I will bring upon them all the good I have promised them. 
    43: Fields shall be purchased in this land, about which you say, “It is a wasteland, without human beings or animals, handed over to the Chaldeans.” 
    44: They will purchase fields with silver, write up deeds, seal them, and have them witnessed in the land of Benjamin, in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah and of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah and the Negeb, when I restore their fortunes—oracle of the Lord.
