Day 173:

Reading Psalm, chapters ['121', '122', '123', '124']:

  Chapter 121.

    1: 
    2: 
The Lord My Guardian
1 A song of ascents.
I raise my eyes toward the mountains.[b]
    From whence shall come my help?
2 
My help comes from the Lord,
    the maker of heaven and earth.

    3: 
He will not allow your foot to slip;
    or your guardian to sleep.

    4: 
Behold, the guardian of Israel
    never slumbers nor sleeps.

    5: 
The Lord is your guardian;
    the Lord is your shade
    at your right hand.

    6: 
By day the sun will not strike you,
    nor the moon by night.

    7: 
The Lord will guard you from all evil;
    he will guard your soul.

    8: 
The Lord will guard your coming and going
    both now and forever.


  Chapter 122.

    1: 
    2: 
A Pilgrim’s Prayer for Jerusalem
1 A song of ascents. Of David.
I
I rejoiced when they said to me,
    “Let us go to the house of the Lord.”
2 
And now our feet are standing
    within your gates, Jerusalem.

    3: 
Jerusalem, built as a city,
    walled round about.

    4: 
There the tribes go up,
    the tribes of the Lord,
As it was decreed for Israel,
    to give thanks to the name of the Lord.

    5: 
There are the thrones of justice,
    the thrones of the house of David.
II

    6: 
For the peace of Jerusalem pray:
    “May those who love you prosper!

    7: 
May peace be within your ramparts,
    prosperity within your towers.”

    8: 
For the sake of my brothers and friends I say,
    “Peace be with you.”

    9: For the sake of the house of the Lord, our God,
    I pray for your good.


  Chapter 123.

    1: 
    2: 
    3: a]
Reliance on the Lord
1 A song of ascents.
To you I raise my eyes,
    to you enthroned in heaven.
2 
Yes, like the eyes of servants
    on the hand of their masters,
Like the eyes of a maid
    on the hand of her mistress,
So our eyes are on the Lord our God,
    till we are shown favor.
3 
Show us favor, Lord, show us favor,
    for we have our fill of contempt.

    4: 
Our souls are more than sated
    with mockery from the insolent,
    with contempt from the arrogant.


  Chapter 124.

    1: 
    2: 
God, the Rescuer of the People
1 A song of ascents. Of David.
Had not the Lord been with us,
    let Israel say,
2 
Had not the Lord been with us,
    when people rose against us,

    3: 
    4: a]
God, the Rescuer of the People
1 A song of ascents. Of David.
Had not the Lord been with us,
    let Israel say,
2 
Had not the Lord been with us,
    when people rose against us,
3 
Then they would have swallowed us alive,
    for their fury blazed against us.
4 
Then the waters would have engulfed us,
    the torrent overwhelmed us;

    5: 
    then seething water would have drowned us.

    6: 
Blessed is the Lord, who did not leave us
    to be torn by their teeth.

    7: 
We escaped with our lives like a bird
    from the fowler’s snare;
    the snare was broken,
    and we escaped.

    8: 
Our help is in the name of the Lord,
    the maker of heaven and earth.
