Day 160:

Reading Psalm, chapters ['69', '70', '71', '72']:

  Chapter 69.

    1: For the leader; according to “Lilies.” Of David.
I

    2: 
Save me, God,
    for the waters have reached my neck.

    3: 
I have sunk into the mire of the deep,
    where there is no foothold.
I have gone down to the watery depths;
    the flood overwhelms me.

    4: 
I am weary with crying out;
    my throat is parched.
My eyes fail,
    from looking for my God.

    5: 
    6: 
A Cry of Anguish in Great Distress
1 For the leader; according to “Lilies.”[b] Of David.
I
2 
Save me, God,
    for the waters[c] have reached my neck.
3 
I have sunk into the mire of the deep,
    where there is no foothold.
I have gone down to the watery depths;
    the flood overwhelms me.
4 
I am weary with crying out;
    my throat is parched.
My eyes fail,
    from looking for my God.
5 
More numerous than the hairs of my head
    are those who hate me without cause.
Those who would destroy me are mighty,
    my enemies without reason.
Must I now restore
    what I did not steal?[d]
II
6 
God, you know my folly;
    my faults are not hidden from you.

    7: 
Let those who wait in hope for you, Lord of hosts,
    not be shamed because of me.
Let those who seek you, God of Israel,
    not be disgraced because of me.

II
6 
God, you know my folly;
    my faults are not hidden from you.
7 
Let those who wait in hope for you, Lord of hosts,
    not be shamed because of me.
Let those who seek you, God of Israel,
    not be disgraced because of me.
8 
For it is on your account I bear insult,
    that disgrace covers my face.
9 
I have become an outcast to my kindred,
    a stranger to my mother’s children.

    10: 
Because zeal for your house has consumed me,
    I am scorned by those who scorn you.

    11: 
When I humbled my spirit with fasting,
    this led only to scorn.

    12: 
When I clothed myself in sackcloth;
    I became a byword for them.

    13: 
Those who sit in the gate gossip about me;
    drunkards make me the butt of songs.
III

    14: 
But I will pray to you, Lord,
    at a favorable time.
God, in your abundant kindness, answer me
    with your sure deliverance.

    15: 
Rescue me from the mire,
    and do not let me sink.
Rescue me from those who hate me
    and from the watery depths.

    16: 
Do not let the flood waters overwhelm me,
    nor the deep swallow me,
    nor the pit close its mouth over me.

    17: 
Answer me, Lord, in your generous love;
    in your great mercy turn to me.

    18: 
Do not hide your face from your servant;
    hasten to answer me, for I am in distress.

    19: 
Come and redeem my life;
    because of my enemies ransom me.

    20: 
You know my reproach, my shame, my disgrace;
    before you stand all my foes.

    21: 
Insult has broken my heart, and I despair;
    I looked for compassion, but there was none,
    for comforters, but found none.

    22: 
Instead they gave me poison for my food;
    and for my thirst they gave me vinegar.
IV

    23: 
May their own table be a snare for them,
    and their communion offerings a trap.

    24: 
Make their eyes so dim they cannot see;
    keep their backs ever feeble.

    25: 
Pour out your wrath upon them;
    let the fury of your anger overtake them.

    26: 
Make their camp desolate,
    with none to dwell in their tents.

    27: 
For they pursued the one you struck,
    added to the pain of the one you wounded.

    28: 
Heap punishment upon their punishment;
    let them gain from you no vindication.

    29: 
May they be blotted from the book of life;
    not registered among the just!
V

    30: 
But here I am miserable and in pain;
    let your saving help protect me, God,

    31: 
That I may praise God’s name in song
    and glorify it with thanksgiving.

    32: 
That will please the Lord more than oxen,
    more than bulls with horns and hooves:

    33: 
“See, you lowly ones, and be glad;
    you who seek God, take heart!

    34: 
For the Lord hears the poor,
    and does not spurn those in bondage.

    35: 
Let the heaven and the earth praise him,
    the seas and whatever moves in them!”
VI

    36: 
For God will rescue Zion,
    and rebuild the cities of Judah.
They will dwell there and possess it;

    37: 
the descendants of God’s servants will inherit it;
    those who love God’s name will dwell in it.


  Chapter 70.

    1: For the leader; of David. For remembrance.

    2: 
Graciously rescue me, God!
    Come quickly to help me, Lord!

    3: 
Let those who seek my life
    be confused and put to shame.
Let those who desire my ruin
    turn back in disgrace.

    4: 
Let those who say “Aha!”
    turn back in their shame.

    5: 
But may all who seek you
    rejoice and be glad in you,
Those who long for your help
    always say, “God be glorified!”

    6: 
    7:

    be confused and put to shame.
Let those who desire my ruin
    turn back in disgrace.
4 
Let those who say “Aha!”
    turn back in their shame.
5 
But may all who seek you
    rejoice and be glad in you,
Those who long for your help
    always say, “God be glorified!”
6 
I am miserable and poor.
    God, come to me quickly!
You are my help and deliverer.
    Lord, do not delay!

    1: a]
Prayer in Time of Old Age
I
1 
In you, Lord, I take refuge;
    let me never be put to shame.

    2: 
In your justice rescue and deliver me;
    listen to me and save me!

    3: 
Be my rock of refuge,
    my stronghold to give me safety;
    for you are my rock and fortress.

    4: 
My God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked,
    from the clutches of the evil and violent.

    5: 
You are my hope, Lord;
    my trust, God, from my youth.

    6: 
    7: 
Prayer in Time of Old Age
I
1 
In you, Lord, I take refuge;
    let me never be put to shame.

    listen to me and save me!
3 
Be my rock of refuge,
    my stronghold to give me safety;
    for you are my rock and fortress.
4 
My God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked,
    from the clutches of the evil and violent.
5 
You are my hope, Lord;
    my trust, God, from my youth.
6 
On you I have depended since birth;
    from my mother’s womb you are my strength;
    my hope in you never wavers.
7 
[b]I have become a portent to many,
    but you are my strong refuge!

    8: 
My mouth shall be filled with your praise,
    shall sing your glory every day.
II

    9: Do not cast me aside in my old age;
    as my strength fails, do not forsake me.

    10: 
For my enemies speak against me;
    they watch and plot against me.

    11: 
They say, “God has abandoned him.
    Pursue, and seize him!
    No one will come to the rescue!”

    12: 
God, be not far from me;
    my God, hasten to help me.

    13: 
Bring to a shameful end
    those who attack me;
Cover with contempt and scorn
    those who seek my ruin.

    14: 
I will always hope in you
    and add to all your praise.

    15: 
My mouth shall proclaim your just deeds,
    day after day your acts of deliverance,
    though I cannot number them all.

    16: 
I will speak of the mighty works of the Lord;
    O God, I will tell of your singular justice.
III

    17: 
God, you have taught me from my youth;
    to this day I proclaim your wondrous deeds.

    18: 
Now that I am old and gray,
    do not forsake me, God,
That I may proclaim your might
    to all generations yet to come,
Your power 
    19: and justice, God,
    to the highest heaven.
You have done great things;
    O God, who is your equal?

    20: 
Whatever bitter afflictions you sent me,
    you would turn and revive me.
From the watery depths of the earth
    once more raise me up.

    21: 
Restore my honor;
    turn and comfort me,

    22: 
That I may praise you with the lyre
    for your faithfulness, my God,
And sing to you with the harp,
    O Holy One of Israel!

    23: 
My lips will shout for joy as I sing your praise;
    my soul, too, which you have redeemed.

    24: 
Yes, my tongue shall recount
    your justice day by day.
For those who sought my ruin
    have been shamed and disgraced.

A Prayer for the King
1 Of Solomon.
I
2 
O God, give your judgment to the king;
    your justice to the king’s son;[b]
That he may govern your people with justice,
    your oppressed with right judgment,

    3: 
That the mountains may yield their bounty for the people,
    and the hills great abundance,

    4: 
That he may defend the oppressed among the people,
    save the children of the poor and crush the oppressor.
II

    5: 
May they fear you with the sun,
    and before the moon, through all generations.

    6: 
    7: 
A Prayer for the King
1 Of Solomon.
I
2 
O God, give your judgment to the king;
    your justice to the king’s son;[b]
That he may govern your people with justice,
    your oppressed with right judgment,
3 
That the mountains may yield their bounty for the people,
    and the hills great abundance,
4 
That he may defend the oppressed among the people,
    save the children of the poor and crush the oppressor.
II
5 
May they fear you with the sun,
    and before the moon, through all generations.
6 
May he be like rain coming down upon the fields,
    like showers watering the earth,
7 
That abundance may flourish in his days,
    great bounty, till the moon be no more.
III

    8: 
May he rule from sea to sea,
    from the river to the ends of the earth.

    9: May his foes kneel before him,
    his enemies lick the dust.

    10: 
May the kings of Tarshish and the islands bring tribute,
    the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.

    11: 
May all kings bow before him,
    all nations serve him.

    12: 
For he rescues the poor when they cry out,
    the oppressed who have no one to help.

    13: 
He shows pity to the needy and the poor
    and saves the lives of the poor.

    14: 
From extortion and violence he redeems them,
    for precious is their blood in his sight.
IV

    15: 
Long may he live, receiving gold from Sheba,
    prayed for without cease, blessed day by day.

    16: 
May wheat abound in the land,
    flourish even on the mountain heights.
May his fruit be like that of Lebanon,
    and flourish in the city like the grasses of the land.

    17: 
May his name be forever;
    as long as the sun, may his name endure.
May the tribes of the earth give blessings with his name;
    may all the nations regard him as favored.

    18: 
Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel,
    who alone does wonderful deeds.

    19: 
Blessed be his glorious name forever;
    may he fill all the earth with his glory.
Amen and amen.
