Day 265:

Reading Hosea, chapters ['13', '14']:

  Chapter 13.

    1: 
The Death of Ephraim
1 
When Ephraim spoke there was terror;
    he was exalted in Israel;
    but he became guilty through Baal and died.

    2: 
    3: The Death of Ephraim
1 
When Ephraim spoke there was terror;
    he was exalted in Israel;
    but he became guilty through Baal and died.
2 
Now they continue to sin,
    making for themselves molten images,
Silver idols according to their skill,
    all of them the work of artisans.
“To these, offer sacrifice,” they say.
    People kiss calves![b]
3 
Therefore, they will be like a morning cloud
    or like the dew that vanishes with the dawn,
Like chaff storm-driven from the threshing floor
    or like smoke out of the window.

    4: 
I, the Lord, am your God,
    since the land of Egypt;
Gods apart from me you do not know;
    there is no savior but me.

    5: 
I fed you in the wilderness,
    in the parched land.

    6: 
When I fed them, they were satisfied;
    when satisfied, they became proud,
    therefore they forgot me.

    7: 
So, I will be like a lion to them,
    like a leopard by the road I will keep watch.

    8: 
I will attack them like a bear robbed of its young,
    and tear their hearts from their breasts;
I will devour them on the spot like a lion,
    as a wild animal would rip them open.

    9: I destroy you, Israel!
    who is there to help you?

    10: 
Where now is your king,
    that he may rescue you?
And all your princes,
    that they may defend you?
Of whom you said,
    “Give me a king and princes”?

    11: 
I give you a king in my anger,
    and I take him away in my wrath.

    12: 
    13: The Death of Ephraim

    or like the dew that vanishes with the dawn,
Like chaff storm-driven from the threshing floor
    or like smoke out of the window.
4 
I, the Lord, am your God,
    since the land of Egypt;[c]
Gods apart from me you do not know;
    there is no savior but me.
5 
I fed you in the wilderness,
    in the parched land.
6 
When I fed them, they were satisfied;
    when satisfied, they became proud,
    therefore they forgot me.
7 
So, I will be like a lion to them,
    like a leopard by the road I will keep watch.
8 
I will attack them like a bear robbed of its young,
    and tear their hearts from their breasts;
I will devour them on the spot like a lion,
    as a wild animal would rip them open.
9 
[d]I destroy you, Israel!
    who is there to help you?
10 
Where now is your king,
    that he may rescue you?
And all your princes,
    that they may defend you?
Of whom you said,
    “Give me a king and princes”?
11 
I give you a king in my anger,
    and I take him away in my wrath.[e]
12 
The guilt of Ephraim is wrapped up,
    his sin is stored away.
13 
[f]The birth pangs will come for him,
    but this is an unwise child,
Who, when it is time, does not present himself
    at the mouth of the womb.

    14: 
Shall I deliver them from the power of Sheol?
    shall I redeem them from death?
Where are your plagues, O death!
    where is your sting, Sheol!
    Compassion is hidden from my eyes.

    15: 
Though Ephraim may flourish among his brothers,
    an east wind will come, a wind from the Lord,
    rising from the wilderness,
That will dry up his spring,
    and leave his fountain dry.
It will loot his treasury
    of every precious thing.


  Chapter 14.

    1: 
1 
Samaria has become guilty,
    for she has rebelled against her God.
They shall fall by the sword,
    their infants shall be dashed to pieces,
    their pregnant women shall be ripped open.
Sincere Conversion and New Life

    2: 
Return, Israel, to the Lord, your God;
    you have stumbled because of your iniquity.

    3: 
    4: 1 
Samaria has become guilty,
    for she has rebelled against her God.
They shall fall by the sword,
    their infants shall be dashed to pieces,
    their pregnant women shall be ripped open.
Sincere Conversion and New Life
2 
Return, Israel, to the Lord, your God;
    you have stumbled because of your iniquity.
3 
Take with you words,
    and return to the Lord;
Say to him, “Forgive all iniquity,
    and take what is good.
    Let us offer the fruit of our lips.
4 
[b]Assyria will not save us,
    nor will we mount horses;
We will never again say, ‘Our god,’
    to the work of our hands;
    for in you the orphan finds compassion.”

    5: 
I will heal their apostasy,
    I will love them freely;
    for my anger is turned away from them.

    6: 
I will be like the dew for Israel:
    he will blossom like the lily;
He will strike root like the Lebanon cedar,

    7: 
    and his shoots will go forth.
His splendor will be like the olive tree
    and his fragrance like Lebanon cedar.

    8: 
Again they will live in his shade;
    they will raise grain,
They will blossom like the vine,
    and his renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.

    9: Ephraim! What more have I to do with idols?
    I have humbled him, but I will take note of him.
I am like a verdant cypress tree.
    From me fruit will be found for you!
Epilogue

    10: 
Who is wise enough to understand these things?
    Who is intelligent enough to know them?
Straight are the paths of the Lord,
    the just walk in them,
    but sinners stumble in them.
