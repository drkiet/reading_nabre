Day 186:

Reading Proverbs, chapters ['21', '22', '23', '24']:

  Chapter 21.

    1: 
    2: 
1 
A king’s heart is channeled water in the hand of the Lord;
    God directs it where he pleases.
2 
All your ways may be straight in your own eyes,
    but it is the Lord who weighs hearts.

    3: 
To do what is right and just
    is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.

    4: 
Haughty eyes and a proud heart—
    the lamp of the wicked will fail.

    5: 
The plans of the diligent end in profit,
    but those of the hasty end in loss.

    6: 
Trying to get rich by lying
    is chasing a bubble over deadly snares.

    7: 
The violence of the wicked will sweep them away,
    because they refuse to do what is right.

    8: 
One’s path may be winding and unfamiliar,
    but one’s conduct is blameless and right.

    9: It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop
    than in a mansion with a quarrelsome woman.

    10: 
The soul of the wicked desires evil;
    their neighbor finds no pity in their eyes.

    11: 
When scoffers are punished the naive become wise;
    when the wise succeed, they gain knowledge.

    12: 
The Righteous One appraises the house of the wicked,
    bringing down the wicked to ruin.

    13: 
Those who shut their ears to the cry of the poor
    will themselves call out and not be answered.

    14: 
A secret gift allays anger,
    and a present concealed, violent wrath.

    15: 
When justice is done it is a joy for the just,
    downfall for evildoers.

    16: 
Whoever strays from the way of good sense
    will abide in the assembly of the shades.

    17: 
The lover of pleasure will suffer want;
    the lover of wine and perfume will never be rich.

    18: 
The wicked serve as ransom for the just,
    and the faithless for the upright.

    19: 
It is better to dwell in a wilderness
    than with a quarrelsome wife and trouble.

    20: 
    21: 1 
A king’s heart is channeled water in the hand of the Lord;
    God directs it where he pleases.

    but it is the Lord who weighs hearts.

It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop
    than in a mansion with a quarrelsome woman.[f]

11 
When scoffers are punished the naive become wise;
    when the wise succeed, they gain knowledge.
12 
The Righteous One appraises the house of the wicked,
    bringing down the wicked to ruin.[g]
13 
Those who shut their ears to the cry of the poor
    will themselves call out and not be answered.

18 
The wicked serve as ransom for the just,
    and the faithless for the upright.[k]
19 
It is better to dwell in a wilderness
    than with a quarrelsome wife and trouble.
20 
Precious treasure and oil are in the house of the wise,
    but the fool consumes them.
21 
Whoever pursues justice and kindness
    will find life and honor.[l]

    22: 
The wise person storms the city of the mighty,
    and overthrows the stronghold in which they trust.

    23: 
Those who guard mouth and tongue
    guard themselves from trouble.

    24: 
Proud, boastful—scoffer is the name:
    those who act with overbearing pride.

    25: 
The desire of sluggards will slay them,
    for their hands refuse to work.

    26: 
Some are consumed with avarice all the day,
    but the just give unsparingly.

    27: 
The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination,
    the more so when they offer it with bad intent.

    28: 
The false witness will perish,
    but one who listens will give lasting testimony.

    29: 
The face of the wicked hardens,
    but the upright maintains a straight course.

    30: 
No wisdom, no understanding,
    no counsel prevail against the Lord.

    31: 
The horse is equipped for the day of battle,
    but victory is the Lord’s.


  Chapter 22.

    1: 
    2: 
1 
A good name is more desirable than great riches,
    and high esteem, than gold and silver.
2 
Rich and poor have a common bond:
    the Lord is the maker of them all.

    3: 
The astute see an evil and hide,
    while the naive continue on and pay the penalty.

    4: 
The result of humility and fear of the Lord
    is riches, honor and life.

    5: 
Thorns and snares are on the path of the crooked;
    those who would safeguard their lives will avoid them.

    6: 
Train the young in the way they should go;
    even when old, they will not swerve from it.

    7: 
The rich rule over the poor,
    and the borrower is the slave of the lender.

    8: 
Those who sow iniquity reap calamity,
    and the rod used in anger will fail.

    9: The generous will be blessed,
    for they share their food with the poor.

    10: 
Expel the arrogant and discord goes too;
    strife and insult cease.

    11: 
The Lord loves the pure of heart;
    the person of winning speech has a king for a friend.

    12: 
The eyes of the Lord watch over the knowledgeable,
    but he defeats the projects of the faithless.

    13: 
The sluggard says, “A lion is outside;
    I might be slain in the street.”

    14: 
The mouth of the foreign woman is a deep pit;
    whoever incurs the Lord’s anger will fall into it.

    15: 
Folly is bound to the heart of a youth,
    but the rod of discipline will drive it out.

    16: 
Oppressing the poor for enrichment,
    giving to the rich: both are sheer loss.

To teach you truly
    how to give a dependable report to one who sends you?
22 
Do not rob the poor because they are poor,
    nor crush the needy at the gate;[l]

    23: 
For the Lord will defend their cause,
    and will plunder those who plunder them.

    24:

Lest you learn their ways,

  Chapter 23.

    1: 
    2: 
    3: 1 
When you sit down to dine with a ruler,
    mark well the one who is before you;
2 
Stick the knife in your gullet[b]
    if you have a ravenous appetite.
3 
Do not desire his delicacies;
    it is food that deceives.

    4: 
Do not wear yourself out to gain wealth,
    cease to be worried about it;

    5: 
When your glance flits to it, it is gone!
    For assuredly it grows wings,
    like the eagle that flies toward heaven.

    6: 
Do not take food with unwilling hosts,
    and do not desire their delicacies;

    7: 
For like something stuck in the throat is that food.
“Eat and drink,” they say to you,
    but their hearts are not with you;

    8: 
The little you have eaten you will vomit up,
    and you will have wasted your agreeable words.

    9: Do not speak in the hearing of fools;
    they will despise the wisdom of your words.

    10: 
Do not remove the ancient landmark,
    nor invade the fields of the fatherless;

    11: 
For their redeemer is strong;
    he will defend their cause against you.

    12: 
Apply your heart to instruction,
    and your ear to words of knowledge.

    13: 
Do not withhold discipline from youths;
    if you beat them with the rod, they will not die.

    14: 
Beat them with the rod,
    and you will save them from Sheol.

    15: 
My son, if your heart is wise,
    my heart also will rejoice;

    16: 
And my inmost being will exult,
    when your lips speak what is right.

    17: 
Do not let your heart envy sinners,
    but only those who always fear the Lord;

    18: 
For you will surely have a future,
    and your hope will not be cut off.

    19: 
Hear, my son, and be wise,
    and guide your heart in the right way.

    20: 
Do not join with wine bibbers,
    nor with those who glut themselves on meat.

    21: 
For drunkards and gluttons come to poverty,
    and lazing about clothes one in rags.

    22: 
    23: 1 
When you sit down to dine with a ruler,
    mark well the one who is before you;
2 
Stick the knife in your gullet[b]
    if you have a ravenous appetite.
3 
Do not desire his delicacies;
    it is food that deceives.
4 
Do not wear yourself out to gain wealth,
    cease to be worried about it;
5 
When your glance flits to it, it is gone!
    For assuredly it grows wings,
    like the eagle that flies toward heaven.[c]
6 
[d]Do not take food with unwilling hosts,
    and do not desire their delicacies;
7 
For like something stuck in the throat is that food.
“Eat and drink,” they say to you,
    but their hearts are not with you;
8 
The little you have eaten you will vomit up,
    and you will have wasted your agreeable words.
9 
Do not speak in the hearing of fools;
    they will despise the wisdom of your words.
10 
Do not remove the ancient landmark,
    nor invade the fields of the fatherless;[e]
11 
For their redeemer is strong;
    he will defend their cause against you.
12 
Apply your heart to instruction,
    and your ear to words of knowledge.
13 
[f]Do not withhold discipline from youths;
    if you beat them with the rod, they will not die.
14 
Beat them with the rod,
    and you will save them from Sheol.
15 
My son, if your heart is wise,
    my heart also will rejoice;
16 
And my inmost being will exult,
    when your lips speak what is right.
17 
Do not let your heart envy sinners,
    but only those who always fear the Lord;[g]
18 
For you will surely have a future,
    and your hope will not be cut off.
19 
Hear, my son, and be wise,
    and guide your heart in the right way.
20 
Do not join with wine bibbers,
    nor with those who glut themselves on meat.
21 
For drunkards and gluttons come to poverty,
    and lazing about clothes one in rags.
22 
[h]Listen to your father who begot you,
    do not despise your mother when she is old.
23 
Buy truth and do not sell:
    wisdom, instruction, understanding!

    24: 
The father of a just person will exult greatly;
    whoever begets a wise son will rejoice in him.

    25: 
Let your father and mother rejoice;
    let her who bore you exult.

    26: 
My son, give me your heart,
    and let your eyes keep to my ways,

    27: 
For the harlot is a deep pit,
    and the foreign woman a narrow well;

    28: 
Yes, she lies in wait like a robber,
    and increases the number of the faithless.

    29: 
Who scream? Who shout?
    Who have strife? Who have anxiety?
Who have wounds for nothing?
    Who have bleary eyes?

    30: 
Whoever linger long over wine,
    whoever go around quaffing wine.

    31: 
Do not look on the wine when it is red,
    when it sparkles in the cup.
It goes down smoothly,

    32: 
    but in the end it bites like a serpent,
    and stings like an adder.

    33: 
Your eyes behold strange sights,
    and your heart utters incoherent things;

    34: 
You are like one sleeping on the high seas,
    sprawled at the top of the mast.

    35: 
“They struck me, but it did not pain me;
    they beat me, but I did not feel it.
When can I get up,
    when can I go out and get more?”


  Chapter 24.

    1: 
    2: 
1 
Do not envy the wicked,
    nor desire to be with them;
2 
For their hearts plot violence,
    and their lips speak of foul play.

    3: 
    4: 1 
Do not envy the wicked,
    nor desire to be with them;
2 
For their hearts plot violence,
    and their lips speak of foul play.
3 
By wisdom a house is built,
    by understanding it is established;
4 
And by knowledge its rooms are filled
    with every precious and pleasing possession.

    5: 
The wise are more powerful than the strong,
    and the learned, than the mighty,

    6: 
For by strategy war is waged,
    and victory depends on many counselors.

    7: 
Wise words are beyond fools’ reach,
    in the assembly they do not open their mouth;

    8: 
As they calculate how to do evil,
    people brand them troublemakers.

    9: The scheme of a fool gains no acceptance,
    the scoffer is an abomination to the community.

    10: 
Did you fail in a day of adversity,
    did your strength fall short?

    11: 
Did you fail to rescue those who were being dragged off to death,
    those tottering, those near death,

    12: 
    because you said, “We didn’t know about it”?
Surely, the Searcher of hearts knows
    and will repay all according to their deeds.

    13: 
If you eat honey, my son, because it is good,
    if pure honey is sweet to your taste,

    14: 
Such, you must know, is wisdom to your soul.
If you find it, you will have a future,
    and your hope will not be cut off.

    15: 
Do not lie in wait at the abode of the just,
    do not ravage their dwelling places;

    16: 
Though the just fall seven times, they rise again,
    but the wicked stumble from only one mishap.

    17: 
Do not rejoice when your enemies fall,
    and when they stumble, do not let your heart exult,

    18: 
Lest the Lord see it, be displeased with you,
    and withdraw his wrath from your enemies.

    19: 
Do not be provoked at evildoers,
    do not envy the wicked;

    20: 
For the evil have no future,
    the lamp of the wicked will be put out.

    21: 
My son, fear the Lord and the king;
    have nothing to do with those who hate them;

    22: 
For disaster will issue suddenly,
    and calamity from them both, who knows when?

V. Further Sayings of the Wise[h]
23 
These also are Words of the Wise:
To show partiality in judgment is not good.
24 
Whoever says to the guilty party, “You are innocent,”
    will be cursed by nations, scorned by peoples;

    25: 
But those who render just verdicts will fare well,
    and on them will come the blessing of prosperity.

    26: 
An honest reply—
    a kiss on the lips.

    27: 
Complete your outdoor tasks,
    and arrange your work in the field;
    afterward you can build your house.

    28: 
Do not testify falsely against your neighbor
    and so deceive with your lips.

    29: 
Do not say, “As they did to me, so will I do to them;
    I will repay them according to their deeds.”

    30: 
I passed by the field of a sluggard,
    by the vineyard of one with no sense;

    31: 
It was all overgrown with thistles;
    its surface was covered with nettles,
    and its stone wall broken down.

    32: 
As I gazed at it, I reflected;
    I saw and learned a lesson:

    33: 
A little sleep, a little slumber,
    a little folding of the arms to rest—

    34: 
Then poverty will come upon you like a robber,
    and want like a brigand.
