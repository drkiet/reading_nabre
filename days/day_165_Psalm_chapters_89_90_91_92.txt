    proclaim your faithfulness through all ages.

For I said, “My mercy is established forever;
    my faithfulness will stand as long as the heavens.

    4: 
I have made a covenant with my chosen one;
    I have sworn to David my servant:

I will make your dynasty stand forever
    and establish your throne through all ages.”

I will sing of your mercy forever, Lord
    proclaim your faithfulness through all ages.
3 
[b]For I said, “My mercy is established forever;
    my faithfulness will stand as long as the heavens.
4 
I have made a covenant with my chosen one;
    I have sworn to David my servant:

Selah
II
6 
The heavens praise your marvels, Lord,
    your loyalty in the assembly of the holy ones.
7 
Who in the skies ranks with the Lord?
    Who is like the Lord among the sons of the gods?[c]
8 
A God dreaded in the council of the holy ones,
    greater and more awesome than all those around him!
9 
Lord, God of hosts, who is like you?
    Mighty Lord, your faithfulness surrounds you.

    10: 
You rule the raging sea;
    you still its swelling waves.

    11: 
You crush Rahab with a mortal blow;
    with your strong arm you scatter your foes.

    12: 
Yours are the heavens, yours the earth;
    you founded the world and everything in it.

    13: 
Zaphon and Amanus you created;
    Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.

    14: 
You have a mighty arm.
    Your hand is strong; your right hand is ever exalted.

    15: 
Justice and judgment are the foundation of your throne;
    mercy and faithfulness march before you.

    16: 
Blessed the people who know the war cry,
    who walk in the radiance of your face, Lord.

    17: 
In your name they sing joyfully all the day;
    they rejoice in your righteousness.

    18: 
You are their majestic strength;
    by your favor our horn is exalted.

    19: 
Truly the Lord is our shield,
    the Holy One of Israel, our king!
III

    20: 
Then you spoke in vision;
    to your faithful ones you said:
“I have set a leader over the warriors;
    I have raised up a chosen one from the people.

    21: 
I have chosen David, my servant;
    with my holy oil I have anointed him.

    22: 
My hand will be with him;
    my arm will make him strong.

    23: 
No enemy shall outwit him,
    nor shall the wicked defeat him.

    24: 
I will crush his foes before him,
    strike down those who hate him.

    25: 
My faithfulness and mercy will be with him;
    through my name his horn will be exalted.

    26: 
I will set his hand upon the sea,
    his right hand upon the rivers.

    27: 
He shall cry to me, ‘You are my father,
    my God, the Rock of my salvation!’

    28: 
I myself make him the firstborn,
    Most High over the kings of the earth.

    29: 
Forever I will maintain my mercy for him;
    my covenant with him stands firm.

    30: 
I will establish his dynasty forever,
    his throne as the days of the heavens.

    31: 
If his descendants forsake my teaching,
    do not follow my decrees,

    32: 
If they fail to observe my statutes,
    do not keep my commandments,

    33: 
I will punish their crime with a rod
    and their guilt with blows.

    34: 
But I will not take my mercy from him,
    nor will I betray my bond of faithfulness.

    35: 
I will not violate my covenant;
    the promise of my lips I will not alter.

    36: 
By my holiness I swore once for all:
    I will never be false to David.

    37: 
His dynasty will continue forever,
    his throne, like the sun before me.

    38: 
Like the moon it will stand eternal,
    forever firm like the sky!”
Selah
B
IV

    39: 
But now you have rejected and spurned,
    been enraged at your anointed.

    40: 
You renounced the covenant with your servant,
    defiled his crown in the dust.

    41: 
You broke down all city walls,
    left his strongholds in ruins.

    42: 
All who pass through seize plunder;
    his neighbors deride him.

    43: 
You have exalted the right hand of his foes,
    have gladdened all his enemies.

    44: 
You turned back his sharp sword,
    did not support him in battle.

    45: 
You brought to an end his splendor,
    hurled his throne to the ground.

    46: 
You cut short the days of his youth,
    covered him with shame.
Selah
V

    47: 
How long, Lord? Will you hide forever?
    Must your wrath smolder like fire?

    48: 
Remember how brief life is,
    how frail the sons of man you have created!

    49: 
What is man, that he should live and not see death?
    Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?
Selah
VI

    50: 
Where are your former mercies, Lord,
    that you swore to David in your faithfulness?

    51: 
Remember, Lord, the insults to your servants,
    how I have borne in my bosom the slander of the nations.

    52: 
Your enemies, Lord, insult;
    they insult each step of your anointed.

    53: 
Blessed be the Lord forever! Amen and amen!


  Chapter 90.

    1: 6
Psalm 90
God’s Eternity and Human Frailty
1 A prayer of Moses, the man of God.
I
Lord, you have been our refuge
    through all generations.

    2: 
Before the mountains were born,
    the earth and the world brought forth,
    from eternity to eternity you are God.

    3: 
You turn humanity back into dust,
    saying, “Return, you children of Adam!”

    4: 
A thousand years in your eyes
    are merely a day gone by,
Before a watch passes in the night,

    5: 
    6: Psalm 90
God’s Eternity and Human Frailty
1 A prayer of Moses, the man of God.
I
Lord, you have been our refuge
    through all generations.
2 
Before the mountains were born,
    the earth and the world brought forth,
    from eternity to eternity you are God.
3 
You turn humanity back into dust,[b]
    saying, “Return, you children of Adam!”
4 
A thousand years in your eyes
    are merely a day gone by,
Before a watch passes in the night,
5 
    [c]you wash them away;
They sleep,
    and in the morning they sprout again like an herb.
6 
In the morning it blooms only to pass away;
    in the evening it is wilted and withered.[d]
II

    7: 
Truly we are consumed by your anger,
    filled with terror by your wrath.

II
7 
Truly we are consumed by your anger,
    filled with terror by your wrath.
8 
You have kept our faults before you,
    our hidden sins in the light of your face.
9 
Our life ebbs away under your wrath;
    our years end like a sigh.
10 
Seventy is the sum of our years,
    or eighty, if we are strong;
Most of them are toil and sorrow;
    they pass quickly, and we are gone.

    11: 
Who comprehends the strength of your anger?
    Your wrath matches the fear it inspires.

    12: 
Teach us to count our days aright,
    that we may gain wisdom of heart.
III

    13: 
Relent, O Lord! How long?
    Have pity on your servants!

    14: 
Fill us at daybreak with your mercy,
    that all our days we may sing for joy.

    15: 
Make us glad as many days as you humbled us,
    for as many years as we have seen trouble.

    16: 
Show your deeds to your servants,
    your glory to their children.

    17: 
May the favor of the Lord our God be ours.
    Prosper the work of our hands!
    Prosper the work of our hands!

Security Under God’s Protection
I
1 
You who dwell in the shelter of the Most High,[b]
    who abide in the shade of the Almighty,

    2: 
Say to the Lord, “My refuge and fortress,
    my God in whom I trust.”

    3: 
He will rescue you from the fowler’s snare,
    from the destroying plague,

    4: 
He will shelter you with his pinions,
    and under his wings you may take refuge;
    his faithfulness is a protecting shield.

    5: 
You shall not fear the terror of the night
    nor the arrow that flies by day,

    6: 
Nor the pestilence that roams in darkness,
    nor the plague that ravages at noon.

    7: 
Though a thousand fall at your side,
    ten thousand at your right hand,
    near you it shall not come.

    ten thousand at your right hand,
    near you it shall not come.
8 
You need simply watch;
    the punishment of the wicked you will see.
9 
Because you have the Lord for your refuge
    and have made the Most High your stronghold,

    10: 
No evil shall befall you,
    no affliction come near your tent.

    11: 
For he commands his angels with regard to you,
    to guard you wherever you go.

    12: 
With their hands they shall support you,
    lest you strike your foot against a stone.

    13: 
You can tread upon the asp and the viper,
    trample the lion and the dragon.
II

    14: 
Because he clings to me I will deliver him;
    because he knows my name I will set him on high.

    15: 
He will call upon me and I will answer;
    I will be with him in distress;
    I will deliver him and give him honor.

    16: 
With length of days I will satisfy him,
    and fill him with my saving power.

    4: 
With the ten-stringed harp,

For you make me jubilant, Lord, by your deeds;
    at the works of your hands I shout for joy.

    indeed your enemies shall perish;

III

    11: 
You have given me the strength of a wild ox;
    you have poured rich oil upon me.

    12: 
My eyes look with glee on my wicked enemies;
    my ears shall hear what happens to my wicked foes.

    13: 
The just shall flourish like the palm tree,
    shall grow like a cedar of Lebanon.

    14: 
Planted in the house of the Lord,
    they shall flourish in the courts of our God.

    15: 
They shall bear fruit even in old age,
    they will stay fresh and green,

    16: 
To proclaim: “The Lord is just;
    my rock, in whom there is no wrong.”
