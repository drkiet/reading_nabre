Day 262:

Reading Hosea, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: 1 The word of the Lord that came to Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel.[b]
I. The Prophet’s Marriage and Its Symbolism
Marriage of Hosea and Gomer. 
    2: When the Lord began to speak with Hosea, the Lord said to Hosea: Go, get for yourself a woman of prostitution and children of prostitution, for the land prostitutes itself, turning away from the Lord.

    3: So he went and took Gomer, daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived and bore him a son. 
    4: Then the Lord said to him: Give him the name “Jezreel,” for in a little while I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed at Jezreel and bring to an end the kingdom of the house of Israel; 
    5: on that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.

    6: She conceived again and bore a daughter. The Lord said to him: Give her the name “Not-Pitied,” for I will no longer feel pity for the house of Israel: rather, I will utterly abhor them. 
    7: Yet for the house of Judah I will feel pity; I will save them by the Lord, their God; but I will not save them by bow or sword, by warfare, by horses or horsemen.

    8: After she weaned Not-Pitied, she conceived and bore a son. 
    9: hen the Lord said: Give him the name “Not-My-People,” for you are not my people, and I am not “I am” for you.


  Chapter 2.

    1: 
    2: 1 
The number of the Israelites
    will be like the sand of the sea,
    which can be neither measured nor counted.
Instead of being told,
    “You are Not-My-People,”
They will be called,
    “Children of the living God.”
2 
Then the people of Judah and of Israel
    will gather together;
They will appoint for themselves one head
    and rise up from the land;
    great indeed shall be the day of Jezreel!

    3: 
Say to your brothers, “My People,”
    and to your sisters, “Pitied.”
The Lord and Israel His Spouse

    4: 
Accuse your mother, accuse!
    for she is not my wife,
    and I am not her husband.
Let her remove her prostitution from her face.
    her adultery from between her breasts,

    5: 
Or I will strip her naked,
    leaving her as on the day of her birth;
I will make her like the wilderness,
    make her like an arid land,
    and let her die of thirst.

    6: 
I will have no pity on her children,
    for they are children of prostitution.

    7: 
Yes, their mother has prostituted herself;
    she who conceived them has acted shamefully.
For she said, “I will go after my lovers,
    who give me my bread and my water,
    my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.”

    8: 
Therefore, I will hedge in her way with thorns
    and erect a wall against her,
    so that she cannot find her paths.

    9: If she runs after her lovers, she will not overtake them;
    if she seeks them she will not find them.
Then she will say,
    “I will go back to my first husband,
    for I was better off then than now.”

    10: 
She did not know
    that it was I who gave her
    the grain, the wine, and the oil,
I who lavished upon her silver,
    and gold, which they used for Baal,

    11: 
Therefore I will take back my grain in its time,
    and my wine in its season;
I will snatch away my wool and my flax,
    which were to cover her nakedness.

    12: 
Now I will lay bare her shame
    in full view of her lovers,
    and no one can deliver her out of my hand.

    13: 
I will put an end to all her joy,
    her festivals, her new moons, her sabbaths—
    all her seasonal feasts.

    14: 
I will lay waste her vines and fig trees,
    of which she said, “These are the fees
    my lovers have given me”;
I will turn them into rank growth
    and wild animals shall devour them.

    15: 
I will punish her for the days of the Baals,
    for whom she burnt incense,
When she decked herself out with her rings and her jewelry,
    and went after her lovers—
    but me she forgot—oracle of the Lord.

    16: 
Therefore, I will allure her now;
    I will lead her into the wilderness
    and speak persuasively to her.

    17: 
Then I will give her the vineyards she had,
    and the valley of Achor as a door of hope.
There she will respond as in the days of her youth,
    as on the day when she came up from the land of Egypt.

    18: 
On that day—oracle of the Lord—
You shall call me “My husband,”
    and you shall never again call me “My baal.”

    19: 
I will remove from her mouth the names of the Baals;
    they shall no longer be mentioned by their name.

    20: 
I will make a covenant for them on that day,
    with the wild animals,
With the birds of the air,
    and with the things that crawl on the ground.
Bow and sword and warfare
    I will destroy from the land,
    and I will give them rest in safety.

    21: 
I will betroth you to me forever:
    I will betroth you to me with justice and with judgment,
    with loyalty and with compassion;

    22: 
I will betroth you to me with fidelity,
    and you shall know the Lord.

    23: 
On that day I will respond—oracle of the Lord—
    I will respond to the heavens,
    and they will respond to the earth;

    24: 
The earth will respond to the grain, and wine, and oil,
    and these will respond to Jezreel.

    25: 
I will sow her for myself in the land,
    and I will have pity on Not-Pitied.
I will say to Not-My-People, “You are my people,”
    and he will say, “My God!”


  Chapter 3.

    1: Again the Lord said to me:
Go, love a woman
    who is loved by her spouse but commits adultery;
Just as the Lord loves the Israelites,
    though they turn to other gods
    and love raisin cakes.

    2: 
    3: Hosea and His Wife Reunited 1 Again the Lord said to me:
Go, love a woman
    who is loved by her spouse but commits adultery;
Just as the Lord loves the Israelites,
    though they turn to other gods
    and love raisin cakes.[b]
2 [c]So I acquired her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a lethech of barley. 3 Then I said to her:
“You will wait for me for many days;
    you will not prostitute yourself
Or belong to any man;
    I in turn will wait for you.”

    4: 
For the Israelites will remain many days
    without king or prince,
Without sacrifice or sacred pillar,
    without ephod or household gods.

    5: 
Afterward the Israelites will turn back
    and seek the Lord, their God,
    and David, their king;
They will come trembling to the Lord
    and to his bounty, in the last days.


  Chapter 4.

    1: 
Hear the word of the Lord, Israelites,
    for the Lord has a dispute
    with the inhabitants of the land:
There is no fidelity, no loyalty,
    no knowledge of God in the land.

    2: 
Swearing, lying, murder,
    stealing and adultery break out;
    bloodshed follows bloodshed.

    3: 
    4: Indictment of Israel
1 
Hear the word of the Lord, Israelites,
    for the Lord has a dispute
    with the inhabitants of the land:
There is no fidelity, no loyalty,
    no knowledge of God in the land.
2 
Swearing, lying, murder,
    stealing and adultery break out;[b]
    bloodshed follows bloodshed.
3 
Therefore the land dries up,
    and everything that dwells in it languishes:
The beasts of the field,
    the birds of the air,
    and even the fish of the sea perish.
Guilt of Priest and of People
4 
But let no one accuse, let no one rebuke;
    with you is my dispute, priest![c]

    5: 
You will stumble in the day,
    and the prophet will stumble with you at night;
    I will make an end of your mother.

    6: 
My people are ruined for lack of knowledge!
    Since you have rejected knowledge,
    I will reject you from serving as my priest;
Since you have forgotten the law of your God,
    I will also forget your children.

    7: 
The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against me,
    I will change their glory into shame.

    8: 
They feed on the sin of my people,
    and are greedy for their iniquity.

    9: Like people, like priest:
    I will punish them for their ways,
    and repay them for their deeds.

    10: 
They will eat but not be satisfied,
    they will promote prostitution but not increase,
Because they have abandoned the Lord,
    devoting themselves

    11: 
    to prostitution.
Aged wine and new wine
    take away understanding.

    12: 
My people consult their piece of wood,
    and their wand makes pronouncements for them,
For the spirit of prostitution has led them astray;
    they prostitute themselves, forsaking their God.

    13: 
On the mountaintops they offer sacrifice
    and on the hills they burn incense,
Beneath oak and poplar and terebinth,
    because of their pleasant shade.
Therefore your daughters prostitute themselves,
    and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.

    14: 
I will not punish your daughters for their prostitution,
    nor your daughters-in-law for their adultery,
Because the men themselves consort with prostitutes,
    and with temple women they offer sacrifice!
Thus a people without understanding comes to ruin.

    15: 
Though you prostitute yourself, Israel,
    do not let Judah become guilty!
Do not come to Gilgal,
    do not go up to Beth-aven,
    do not swear, “As the Lord lives!”

    16: 
For like a stubborn cow,
    Israel is stubborn;
Will the Lord now pasture them,
    like lambs in a broad meadow?

    17: 
Ephraim is bound to idols,
    let him alone!

    18: 
When their drinking is over,
    they give themselves to prostitution;
    they love shame more than their honor.

    19: 
A wind has bound them up in its wings;
    they shall be ashamed because of their altars.
