Day 193:

Reading Song-of-Songs, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: 
M I have come to my garden, my sister, my bride;
    I gather my myrrh with my spices,
I eat my honeycomb with my honey,
    I drink my wine with my milk.
D? Eat, friends; drink!
    Drink deeply, lovers!
A Fruitless Search

    2: 
W I was sleeping, but my heart was awake.
    The sound of my lover knocking!
“Open to me, my sister, my friend,
    my dove, my perfect one!
For my head is wet with dew,
    my hair, with the moisture of the night.”

    3: 
I have taken off my robe,
    am I then to put it on?
I have bathed my feet,
    am I then to soil them?

    4: 
    5: 1 
M I have come to my garden, my sister, my bride;
    I gather my myrrh with my spices,
I eat my honeycomb with my honey,
    I drink my wine with my milk.
D? Eat, friends; drink!
    Drink deeply, lovers!
A Fruitless Search
2 
W I was sleeping, but my heart was awake.[b]
    The sound of my lover knocking!
“Open to me, my sister, my friend,
    my dove, my perfect one!
For my head is wet with dew,
    my hair, with the moisture of the night.”
3 
I have taken off my robe,[c]
    am I then to put it on?
I have bathed my feet,
    am I then to soil them?
4 
My lover put his hand in through the opening:
    my innermost being[d] trembled because of him.
5 
I rose to open for my lover,
    my hands dripping myrrh:
My fingers, flowing myrrh
    upon the handles of the lock.

    6: 
I opened for my lover—
    but my lover had turned and gone!
    At his leaving, my soul sank.
I sought him, but I did not find him;
    I called out after him, but he did not answer me.

    7: 
The watchmen found me,
    as they made their rounds in the city;
They beat me, they wounded me,
    they tore off my mantle,
    the watchmen of the walls.

    8: 
I adjure you, Daughters of Jerusalem,
    if you find my lover
What shall you tell him?
    that I am sick with love.
The Lost Lover Described

    9: D How does your lover differ from any other lover,
    most beautiful among women?
How does your lover differ from any other,
    that you adjure us so?

    10: 
W My lover is radiant and ruddy;
    outstanding among thousands.

    11: 
His head is gold, pure gold,
    his hair like palm fronds,
    as black as a raven.

    12: 
His eyes are like doves
    beside streams of water,
Bathing in milk,
    sitting by brimming pools.

    13: 
His cheeks are like beds of spices
    yielding aromatic scents;
his lips are lilies
    that drip flowing myrrh.

    14: 
His arms are rods of gold
    adorned with gems;
His loins, a work of ivory
    covered with sapphires.

    15: 
His legs, pillars of alabaster,
    resting on golden pedestals.
His appearance, like the Lebanon,
    imposing as the cedars.

    16: 
His mouth is sweetness itself;
    he is delightful in every way.
Such is my lover, and such my friend,
    Daughters of Jerusalem!


  Chapter 6.

    1: 
D Where has your lover gone,
    most beautiful among women?
Where has your lover withdrawn
    that we may seek him with you?

    2: 
W My lover has come down to his garden,
    to the beds of spices,
To feed in the gardens
    and to gather lilies.

    3: 
I belong to my lover, and my lover belongs to me;
    he feeds among the lilies.
The Beauty of the Woman

    4: 
M Beautiful as Tirzah are you, my friend;
    fair as Jerusalem,
    fearsome as celestial visions!

    5: 
    6: The Lost Lover Found
1 
D Where has your lover gone,
    most beautiful among women?
Where has your lover withdrawn
    that we may seek him with you?
2 
W My lover has come down to his garden,[b]
    to the beds of spices,
To feed in the gardens
    and to gather lilies.
3 
I belong to my lover, and my lover belongs to me;
    he feeds among the lilies.
The Beauty of the Woman
4 
M Beautiful as Tirzah are you, my friend;[c]
    fair as Jerusalem,
    fearsome as celestial visions!
5 
Turn your eyes away from me,
    for they stir me up.
Your hair is like a flock of goats
    streaming down from Gilead.
6 
Your teeth are like a flock of ewes
    that come up from the washing,
All of them big with twins,
    none of them barren.

    7: 
Like pomegranate halves,
    your cheeks behind your veil.

    8: 
Sixty are the queens, eighty the concubines,
    and young women without number—

    9: One alone is my dove, my perfect one,
    her mother’s special one,
    favorite of the one who bore her.
Daughters see her and call her happy,
    queens and concubines, and they praise her:

    10: 
“Who is this that comes forth like the dawn,
    beautiful as the white moon, pure as the blazing sun,
    fearsome as celestial visions?”
Love’s Meeting

    11: 
W To the walnut grove I went down,
    to see the young growth of the valley;
To see if the vines were in bloom,
    if the pomegranates had blossomed.

    12: 
Before I knew it, my desire had made me
    the blessed one of the prince’s people.


  Chapter 7.

    1: 
D? Turn, turn, O Shulammite!
    turn, turn that we may gaze upon you!
W How can you gaze upon the Shulammite
    as at the dance of the two camps?

    2: 
M How beautiful are your feet in sandals,
    O noble daughter!
Your curving thighs like jewels,
    the product of skilled hands.

    3: 
Your valley, a round bowl
    that should never lack mixed wine.
Your belly, a mound of wheat,
    encircled with lilies.

    4: 
Your breasts are like two fawns,
    twins of a gazelle.

    5: 
Your neck like a tower of ivory;
    your eyes, pools in Heshbon
    by the gate of Bath-rabbim.
Your nose like the tower of Lebanon
    that looks toward Damascus.

    6: 
    7: The Beauty of the Beloved
1 
D? Turn, turn, O Shulammite!
    turn, turn that we may gaze upon you!
W How can you gaze upon the Shulammite
    as at the dance of the two camps?
2 
M How beautiful are your feet in sandals,[b]
    O noble daughter!
Your curving thighs like jewels,
    the product of skilled hands.
3 
Your valley,[c] a round bowl
    that should never lack mixed wine.
Your belly, a mound of wheat,
    encircled with lilies.
4 
Your breasts are like two fawns,
    twins of a gazelle.
5 
Your neck like a tower of ivory;
    your eyes, pools in Heshbon
    by the gate of Bath-rabbim.
Your nose like the tower of Lebanon
    that looks toward Damascus.[d]
6 
Your head rises upon you like Carmel;[e]
    your hair is like purple;
    a king is caught in its locks.
Love’s Desires
7 
How beautiful you are, how fair,
    my love, daughter of delights!

    8: 
Your very form resembles a date-palm,
    and your breasts, clusters.

    9: I thought, “Let me climb the date-palm!
    Let me take hold of its branches!
Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine
    and the fragrance of your breath like apples,

    10: 
And your mouth like the best wine—
    Wthat flows down smoothly for my lover,
    gliding over my lips and teeth.

    11: 
I belong to my lover,
    his yearning is for me.

    12: 
Come, my lover! Let us go out to the fields,
    let us pass the night among the henna.

    13: 
Let us go early to the vineyards, and see
    if the vines are in bloom,
If the buds have opened,
    if the pomegranates have blossomed;
There will I give you my love.

    14: 
The mandrakes give forth fragrance,
    and over our doors are all choice fruits;
Fruits both fresh and dried, my lover,
    have I kept in store for you.


  Chapter 8.

    1: 
Would that you were a brother to me,
    nursed at my mother’s breasts!
If I met you out of doors, I would kiss you
    and none would despise me.

    2: 
I would lead you, bring you to my mother’s house,
    where you would teach me,
Where I would give you to drink
    spiced wine, my pomegranate juice.

    3: 
His left hand is under my head,
    and his right arm embraces me.

    4: 
I adjure you, Daughters of Jerusalem,
    do not awaken or stir up love
    until it is ready!
The Return from the Desert

    5: 
D? Who is this coming up from the desert,
    leaning upon her lover?
W Beneath the apple tree I awakened you;
    there your mother conceived you;
    there she who bore you conceived.
True Love

    6: 
Set me as a seal upon your heart,
    as a seal upon your arm;
For Love is strong as Death,
    longing is fierce as Sheol.
Its arrows are arrows of fire,
    flames of the divine.

    7: 
    8: 1 
Would that you were a brother to me,
    nursed at my mother’s breasts!
If I met you out of doors, I would kiss you
    and none would despise me.
2 
I would lead you, bring you to my mother’s house,
    where you would teach me,
Where I would give you to drink
    spiced wine, my pomegranate juice.
3 
His left hand is under my head,
    and his right arm embraces me.
4 
I adjure you, Daughters of Jerusalem,
    do not awaken or stir up love
    until it is ready!
The Return from the Desert
5 
D? Who is this coming up from the desert,
    leaning upon her lover?
W Beneath the apple tree I awakened you;[b]
    there your mother conceived you;
    there she who bore you conceived.
True Love
6 
Set me as a seal[c] upon your heart,
    as a seal upon your arm;
For Love is strong as Death,
    longing is fierce as Sheol.
Its arrows are arrows of fire,
    flames of the divine.
7 
Deep waters[d] cannot quench love,
    nor rivers sweep it away.
Were one to offer all the wealth of his house for love,
    he would be utterly despised.
An Answer to the Brothers
8 
W “We have a little sister;[e]
    she has no breasts as yet.
What shall we do for our sister
    on the day she is spoken for?

    9: If she is a wall,
    we will build upon her a silver turret;
But if she is a door,
    we will board her up with cedar planks.”

    10: 
I am a wall,
    and my breasts are like towers.
I became in his eyes
    as one who brings peace.
A Boast

    11: 
M? Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
    he gave over the vineyard to caretakers.
For its fruit one would have to pay
    a thousand silver pieces.

    12: 
My vineyard is at my own disposal;
    the thousand pieces are for you, Solomon,
    and two hundred for the caretakers of its fruit.
The Lovers’ Yearnings

    13: 
M You who dwell in the gardens,
    my companions are listening for your voice—
    let me hear it!

    14: 
W Swiftly, my lover,
    be like a gazelle or a young stag
    upon the mountains of spices.
