Reading Psalm, chapters ['33', '34', '35', '36']:

  Chapter 33.

    1: 
Rejoice, you righteous, in the Lord;
    praise from the upright is fitting.

    2: 
    3: 
Praise of God’s Power and Providence
I
1 
Rejoice, you righteous, in the Lord;
    praise from the upright is fitting.
2 
Give thanks to the Lord on the harp;
    on the ten-stringed lyre offer praise.
3 
Sing to him a new song;
    skillfully play with joyful chant.

    4: 
For the Lord’s word is upright;
    all his works are trustworthy.

    5: 
He loves justice and right.
    The earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.
II

    6: 
By the Lord’s word the heavens were made;
    by the breath of his mouth all their host.

    7: 
He gathered the waters of the sea as a mound;
    he sets the deep into storage vaults.
III

    8: 
Let all the earth fear the Lord;
    let all who dwell in the world show him reverence.

    9: For he spoke, and it came to be,
    commanded, and it stood in place.

    10: 
The Lord foils the plan of nations,
    frustrates the designs of peoples.

    11: 
But the plan of the Lord stands forever,
    the designs of his heart through all generations.

    12: 
Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord,
    the people chosen as his inheritance.
IV

    13: 
From heaven the Lord looks down
    and observes the children of Adam,

    14: 
From his dwelling place he surveys
    all who dwell on earth.

    15: 
The One who fashioned together their hearts
    is the One who knows all their works.
V

    16: 
A king is not saved by a great army,
    nor a warrior delivered by great strength.

    17: 
Useless is the horse for safety;
    despite its great strength, it cannot be saved.

    18: 
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon those who fear him,
    upon those who count on his mercy,

    19: 
To deliver their soul from death,
    and to keep them alive through famine.
VI

    20: 
Our soul waits for the Lord,
    he is our help and shield.

    21: 
For in him our hearts rejoice;
    in his holy name we trust.

    22: 
May your mercy, Lord, be upon us;
    as we put our hope in you.


  Chapter 34.

    1: Of David, when he feigned madness before Abimelech, who drove him out and he went away.
I

    2: 
    3: 
    4: a]
Thanksgiving to God Who Delivers the Just
1 Of David, when he feigned madness before Abimelech,[b] who drove him out and he went away.
I
2 
I will bless the Lord at all times;
    his praise shall be always in my mouth.
3 
My soul will glory in the Lord;
    let the poor hear and be glad.
4 
Magnify the Lord with me;
    and let us exalt his name together.
II

    5: 
I sought the Lord, and he answered me,
    delivered me from all my fears.

    6: 
Look to him and be radiant,
    and your faces may not blush for shame.

    7: 
This poor one cried out and the Lord heard,
    and from all his distress he saved him.

    8: 
The angel of the Lord encamps
    around those who fear him, and he saves them.

    9: Taste and see that the Lord is good;
    blessed is the stalwart one who takes refuge in him.

    10: 
Fear the Lord, you his holy ones;
    nothing is lacking to those who fear him.

    11: 
The rich grow poor and go hungry,
    but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.
III

    12: 
Come, children, listen to me;
    I will teach you fear of the Lord.

    13: 
Who is the man who delights in life,
    who loves to see the good days?

    14: 
Keep your tongue from evil,
    your lips from speaking lies.

    15: 
Turn from evil and do good;
    seek peace and pursue it.

    16: 
The eyes of the Lord are directed toward the righteous
    and his ears toward their cry.

    17: 
The Lord’s face is against evildoers
    to wipe out their memory from the earth.

    18: 
The righteous cry out, the Lord hears
    and he rescues them from all their afflictions.

    19: 
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted,
    saves those whose spirit is crushed.

    20: 
Many are the troubles of the righteous,
    but the Lord delivers him from them all.

    21: 
He watches over all his bones;
    not one of them shall be broken.

    22: 
Evil will slay the wicked;
    those who hate the righteous are condemned.

    23: 
The Lord is the redeemer of the souls of his servants;
    and none are condemned who take refuge in him.


  Chapter 35.

    1: Of David.
I
Oppose, O Lord, those who oppose me;
    war upon those who make war upon me.

    2: 
    3: 
Prayer for Help Against Unjust Enemies
1 Of David.
I
[b]Oppose, O Lord, those who oppose me;
    war upon those who make war upon me.
2 
Take up the shield and buckler;
    rise up in my defense.
3 
Brandish lance and battle-ax
    against my pursuers.
Say to my soul,
    “I am your salvation.”

    4: 
    5: a]
Prayer for Help Against Unjust Enemies
1 Of David.
I
[b]Oppose, O Lord, those who oppose me;
    war upon those who make war upon me.
2 
Take up the shield and buckler;
    rise up in my defense.
3 
Brandish lance and battle-ax
    against my pursuers.
Say to my soul,
    “I am your salvation.”
4 
Let those who seek my life
    be put to shame and disgrace.
Let those who plot evil against me
    be turned back and confounded.
5 
Make them like chaff before the wind,
    with the angel of the Lord driving them on.

    6: 
Make their way slippery and dark,
    with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.
II

    7: 
Without cause they set their snare for me;
    without cause they dug a pit for me.

    8: 
Let ruin overtake them unawares;
    let the snare they have set catch them;
    let them fall into the pit they have dug.

    9: Then I will rejoice in the Lord,
    exult in God’s salvation.

    10: 
My very bones shall say,
    “O Lord, who is like you,
Who rescue the afflicted from the powerful,
    the afflicted and needy from the despoiler?”
III

    11: 
Malicious witnesses rise up,
    accuse me of things I do not know.

    12: 
They repay me evil for good;
    my soul is desolate.

    13: 
Yet I, when they were ill, put on sackcloth,
    afflicted myself with fasting,
    sobbed my prayers upon my bosom.

    14: 
I went about in grief as for my brother,
    bent in mourning as for my mother.

    15: 
Yet when I stumbled they gathered with glee,
    gathered against me and I did not know it.
They slandered me without ceasing;

    16: 
    without respect they mocked me,
    gnashed their teeth against me.
IV

    17: 
O Lord, how long will you look on?
    Restore my soul from their destruction,
    my very life from lions!

    18: 
Then I will thank you in the great assembly;
    I will praise you before the mighty throng.

    19: 
Do not let lying foes rejoice over me,
    my undeserved enemies wink knowingly.

    20: 
They speak no words of peace,
    but against the quiet in the land
    they fashion deceitful speech.

    21: 
They open wide their mouths against me.
    They say, “Aha! Good!
    Our eyes have seen it!”

    22: 
You see this, Lord; do not be silent;
    Lord, do not withdraw from me.

    23: 
Awake, be vigilant in my defense,
    in my cause, my God and my Lord.

    24: 
Defend me because you are just, Lord;
    my God, do not let them rejoice over me.

    25: 
Do not let them say in their hearts,
    “Aha! Our soul!”
Do not let them say,
    “We have devoured that one!”

    26: 
Put to shame and confound
    all who relish my misfortune.
Clothe with shame and disgrace
    those who lord it over me.

    27: 
But let those who favor my just cause
    shout for joy and be glad.
May they ever say, “Exalted be the Lord
    who delights in the peace of his loyal servant.”

    28: 
Then my tongue shall recount your justice,
    declare your praise, all the day long.


  Chapter 36.

    1: For the leader. Of David, the servant of the Lord.
I

    2: 
    3: 
Human Wickedness and Divine Providence
1 For the leader. Of David, the servant of the Lord.
I
2 
Sin directs the heart of the wicked man;
    his eyes are closed to the fear of God.
3 
For he lives with the delusion:
    his guilt will not be known and hated.[b]

    4: 
Empty and false are the words of his mouth;
    he has ceased to be wise and do good.

    5: 
    6: a]
Human Wickedness and Divine Providence
1 For the leader. Of David, the servant of the Lord.
I
2 
Sin directs the heart of the wicked man;
    his eyes are closed to the fear of God.
3 
For he lives with the delusion:
    his guilt will not be known and hated.[b]
4 
Empty and false are the words of his mouth;
    he has ceased to be wise and do good.
5 
On his bed he hatches plots;
    he sets out on a wicked way;
    he does not reject evil.
II
6 
[c]Lord, your mercy reaches to heaven;
    your fidelity, to the clouds.

    7: 
Your justice is like the highest mountains;
    your judgments, like the mighty deep;
    human being and beast you sustain, Lord.

    8: 
How precious is your mercy, O God!
    The children of Adam take refuge in the shadow of your wings.

    9: They feast on the rich food of your house;
    from your delightful stream you give them drink.

    10: 
For with you is the fountain of life,
    and in your light we see light.

    11: 
Show mercy on those who know you,
    your just defense to the upright of heart.

    12: 
Do not let the foot of the proud overtake me,
    nor the hand of the wicked disturb me.

    13: 
There make the evildoers fall;
    thrust them down, unable to rise.
