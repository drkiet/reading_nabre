Day 207:

Reading Ben-Sira, chapters ['33', '34', '35', '36']:

  Chapter 33.

    1: 
No evil can harm the one who fears the Lord;
    through trials, again and again he is rescued.

    2: 
    3: 
1 
No evil can harm the one who fears the Lord;
    through trials, again and again he is rescued.
2 
Whoever hates the law is without wisdom,
    and is tossed about like a boat in a storm.
3 
The prudent trust in the word of the Lord,
    and the law is dependable for them as a divine oracle.

    4: 
Prepare your words and then you will be listened to;
    draw upon your training, and give your answer.

    5: 
Like the wheel of a cart is the mind of a fool,
    and his thoughts like a turning axle.

    6: 
A mocking friend is like a stallion
    that neighs, no matter who the rider may be.

    7: 
Why is one day more important than another,
    when the same sun lights up every day of the year?

    8: 
By the Lord’s knowledge they are kept distinct;
    and he designates the seasons and feasts.

    9: Some he exalts and sanctifies,
    and others he lists as ordinary days.

    10: 
Likewise, all people are of clay,
    and from earth humankind was formed;

    11: 
In the fullness of his knowledge the Lord distinguished them,
    and he designated their different ways.

    12: 
Some he blessed and exalted,
    and some he sanctified and drew to himself.
Others he cursed and brought low,
    and expelled them from their place.

    13: 
Like clay in the hands of a potter,
    to be molded according to his pleasure,
So are people in the hands of their Maker,
    to be dealt with as he decides.

    14: 
As evil contrasts with good, and death with life,
    so are sinners in contrast with the godly.

    15: 
See now all the works of the Most High:
    they come in pairs, one the opposite of the other.

    16: 
Now I am the last to keep vigil,
    like a gleaner following the grape-pickers;

    17: 
Since by the Lord’s blessing I have made progress
    till like a grape-picker I have filled my wine press,

    18: 
Consider that not for myself only have I labored,
    but for all who seek instruction.
Property and Servants

    19: 
Listen to me, leaders of the people;
    rulers of the congregation, pay heed!

    20:  
Let neither son nor wife, neither brother nor friend,
    have power over you as long as you live.

    21: 
While breath of life is still in you,
    let no one take your place.
20b 
Do not give your wealth to another,
    lest you must plead for support yourself.

    22: 
Far better that your children plead with you
    than that you should look for a handout from them.

    23: 
Keep control over all your affairs;
    bring no stain on your honor.

    24: 
When your few days reach their limit,
    at the time of death distribute your inheritance.

    25: 
Fodder and whip and loads for a donkey;
    food, correction and work for a slave.

    26: 
Make a slave work, and he will look for rest;
    let his hands be idle and he will seek to be free.

    27: 
The yoke and harness will bow the neck;
    and for a wicked slave, punishment in the stocks.

    28: 
Force him to work that he be not idle,

    29: 
    for idleness teaches much mischief.

    30: 
Put him to work, as is fitting for him;
    and if he does not obey, load him with chains.
But never lord it over any human being,
    and do nothing unjust.

    31: 
If you have but one slave, treat him like yourself,
    for you have acquired him with your life’s blood;
If you have but one slave, deal with him as a brother,
    for you need him as you need your life.

    32: 
    33: 1 
No evil can harm the one who fears the Lord;
    through trials, again and again he is rescued.
2 
Whoever hates the law is without wisdom,
    and is tossed about like a boat in a storm.

    and the law is dependable for them as a divine oracle.

    that neighs, no matter who the rider may be.
7 
[b]Why is one day more important than another,
    when the same sun lights up every day of the year?
8 
By the Lord’s knowledge they are kept distinct;
    and he designates the seasons and feasts.
9

15 
See now all the works of the Most High:
    they come in pairs, one the opposite of the other.
16 
Now I am the last to keep vigil,[c]
    like a gleaner following the grape-pickers;
17 
Since by the Lord’s blessing I have made progress
    till like a grape-picker I have filled my wine press,
18 
Consider that not for myself only have I labored,
    but for all who seek instruction.
Property and Servants[d]
19

If you have but one slave, deal with him as a brother,
    for you need him as you need your life.
32 
If you mistreat him and he runs away,
33 
    in what direction will you look for him?


  Chapter 34.

    1: 
Empty and false are the hopes of the senseless,
    and dreams give wings to fools.

    2: 
    3: 
    4: Trust in the Lord and Not in Dreams
1 
Empty and false are the hopes of the senseless,
    and dreams give wings to fools.
2 
Like one grasping at shadows or chasing the wind,
    so anyone who believes in dreams.
3 
What is seen in dreams is a reflection,
    the likeness of a face looking at itself.
4 
How can the unclean produce what is clean?
    How can the false produce what is true?

    5: 
Divination, omens, and dreams are unreal;
    what you already expect, the mind fantasizes.

    6: 
Unless they are specially sent by the Most High,
    do not fix your heart on them.

    7: 
For dreams have led many astray,
    and those who put their hope in them have perished.

    8: 
Without such deceptions the Law will be fulfilled,
    and in the mouth of the faithful is complete wisdom.

    9: A much-traveled person knows many things;
    and one with much experience speaks sense.

    10: 
An inexperienced person knows little,

    11: 
    whereas with travel one adds to resourcefulness.

    12: 
I have seen much in my travels,
    and learned more than I could ever say.

    13: 
Often I was in danger of death,
    but by these experiences I was saved.

    14: 
Living is the spirit of those who fear the Lord,

    15: 
    for their hope is in their savior.

    16: 
Whoever fear the Lord are afraid of nothing
    and are never discouraged, for he is their hope.

    17: 
Happy the soul that fears the Lord!

    18: 
    In whom does he trust, and who is his support?

    19: 
The eyes of the Lord are upon those who love him;
    he is their mighty shield and strong support,
A shelter from the heat, a shade from the noonday sun,
    a guard against stumbling, a help against falling.

    20: 
He lifts up spirits, brings a sparkle to the eyes,
    gives health and life and blessing.
True Worship of God

    21: 
Ill-gotten goods offered in sacrifice are tainted.

    22: 
    Presents from the lawless do not win God’s favor.

    23: 
The Most High is not pleased with the gifts of the godless,
    nor for their many sacrifices does he forgive their sins.

    24: 
One who slays a son in his father’s presence—
    whoever offers sacrifice from the holdings of the poor.

    25: 
The bread of charity is life itself for the needy;
    whoever withholds it is a murderer.

    26: 
To take away a neighbor’s living is to commit murder;

    27: 
    to deny a laborer wages is to shed blood.

    28: 
If one builds up and another tears down,
    what do they gain but trouble?

    29: 
If one prays and another curses,
    whose voice will God hear?

    30: 
If one again touches a corpse after bathing,
    what does he gain by the purification?

    31: 
So one who fasts for sins,
    but goes and commits them again:
Who will hear his prayer,
    what is gained by mortification?


  Chapter 35.

    1: 
To keep the law is to make many offerings;

    2: 
    3: 
1 
To keep the law is to make many offerings;
2 
    whoever observes the commandments sacrifices a peace offering.
3 
By works of charity one offers fine flour,[b]

    4: 
    5: a]
1 
To keep the law is to make many offerings;
2 
    whoever observes the commandments sacrifices a peace offering.
3 
By works of charity one offers fine flour,[b]
4 
    and one who gives alms presents a sacrifice of praise.
5 
To refrain from evil pleases the Lord,
    and to avoid injustice is atonement.

    6: 
Do not appear before the Lord empty-handed,

    7: 
    for all that you offer is in fulfillment of the precepts.

    8: 
The offering of the just enriches the altar:
    a sweet odor before the Most High.

    9: The sacrifice of the just is accepted,
    never to be forgotten.

    10: 
With a generous spirit pay homage to the Lord,
    and do not spare your freewill gifts.

    11: 
With each contribution show a cheerful countenance,
    and pay your tithes in a spirit of joy.

    12: 
Give to the Most High as he has given to you,
    generously, according to your means.

    13: 
For he is a God who always repays
    and will give back to you sevenfold.

    14: 
But offer no bribes; these he does not accept!

    15: 
    Do not trust in sacrifice of the fruits of extortion,
For he is a God of justice,
    who shows no partiality.

    16: 
He shows no partiality to the weak
    but hears the grievance of the oppressed.

    17: 
He does not forsake the cry of the orphan,
    nor the widow when she pours out her complaint.

    18: 
Do not the tears that stream down her cheek

    19: 
    cry out against the one that causes them to fall?

    20: 
Those who serve God to please him are accepted;
    their petition reaches the clouds.

    21: 
The prayer of the lowly pierces the clouds;
    it does not rest till it reaches its goal;
Nor will it withdraw till the Most High responds,

    22: 
    judges justly and affirms the right.
God indeed will not delay,
    and like a warrior, will not be still
Till he breaks the backs of the merciless

    23: 
    and wreaks vengeance upon the nations;
Till he destroys the scepter of the proud,
    and cuts off the staff of the wicked;

    24: 
Till he requites everyone according to their deeds,
    and repays them according to their thoughts;

    25: 
Till he defends the cause of his people,
    and makes them glad by his salvation.

    26: 
Welcome is his mercy in time of distress
    as rain clouds in time of drought.


  Chapter 36.

    1: 
Come to our aid, O God of the universe,

    2: 
    3: 
A Prayer for God’s People
1 
Come to our aid, O God of the universe,
2 
    and put all the nations in dread of you!
3 
Raise your hand against the foreign people,
    that they may see your mighty deeds.

    4: 
As you have used us to show them your holiness,
    so now use them to show us your glory.

    5: 
    6: A Prayer for God’s People
1 
Come to our aid, O God of the universe,
2 
    and put all the nations in dread of you!
3 
Raise your hand against the foreign people,
    that they may see your mighty deeds.
4 
As you have used us to show them your holiness,[b]
    so now use them to show us your glory.
5 
Thus they will know, as we know,
    that there is no God but you.
6 
Give new signs and work new wonders;

    7: 
    show forth the splendor of your right hand and arm.

    8: 
Rouse your anger, pour out wrath;

    9:     humble the enemy, scatter the foe.

    10: 
Hasten the ending, appoint the time,
    and let people proclaim your mighty deeds.

    11: 
Let raging fire consume the fugitive,
    and your people’s oppressors meet destruction.

    12: 
Crush the heads of the hostile rulers
    who say, “There is no one besides me.”

    13: 
Gather all the tribes of Jacob,
16 
    that they may inherit the land as in days of old.
17 
Show mercy to the people called by your name:
    Israel, whom you named your firstborn.
18 
Take pity on your holy city:
    Jerusalem, your dwelling place.
19 
Fill Zion with your majesty,
    your temple with your glory.
20 
Give evidence of your deeds of old;
    fulfill the prophecies spoken in your name.
21 
Reward those who have hoped in you,
    and let your prophets be proved true.
22 
Hear the prayer of your servants,
    according to your good will toward your people.
Thus all the ends of the earth will know
    that you are the eternal God.
Choice of Associates[d]
23 
The throat can swallow any food,
    yet some foods are more agreeable than others.
24 
The palate tests delicacies put forward as gifts,
    so does a keen mind test deceitful tidbits.
25 
One with a tortuous heart brings about grief,
    but an experienced person can turn the tables on him.
26 
A woman will accept any man as husband,
    but one woman will be preferable to another.
27 
A woman’s beauty makes her husband’s face light up,
    for it surpasses all else that delights the eye.
28 
And if, besides, her speech is soothing,
    her husband’s lot is beyond that of mortal men.
29 
A wife is her husband’s richest treasure,
    a help like himself and a staunch support.
30 
A vineyard with no hedge will be overrun;
    and a man with no wife becomes a homeless wanderer.
31 
Who will trust an armed band
    that shifts from city to city?
Or a man who has no nest,
    who lodges wherever night overtakes him?
