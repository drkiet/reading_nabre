Day 116:

Reading Tobit, chapters ['13', '14']:

  Chapter 13.

    1: 
1 Then Tobit spoke and composed a song of joyful praise; he said:
Blessed be God who lives forever,
    because his kingship lasts for all ages.

    2: 
    3: 1 Then Tobit spoke and composed a song of joyful praise; he said:
Blessed be God who lives forever,
    because his kingship lasts for all ages.
2 
For he afflicts and shows mercy,
    casts down to the depths of Hades,
    brings up from the great abyss.
What is there that can snatch from his hand?
3 
Give thanks to him, you Israelites, in the presence of the nations,
    for though he has scattered you among them,

    4: 
    even there recount his greatness.
Exalt him before every living being,
    because he is your Lord, and he is your God,
    our Father and God forever and ever!

    5: 
He will afflict you for your iniquities,
    but will have mercy on all of you.
He will gather you from all the nations
    among whom you have been scattered.

    6: 
When you turn back to him with all your heart,
    and with all your soul do what is right before him,
Then he will turn to you,
    and will hide his face from you no longer.
Now consider what he has done for you,
    and give thanks with full voice.
Bless the Lord of righteousness,
    and exalt the King of the ages.
In the land of my captivity I give thanks,
    and declare his power and majesty to a sinful nation.
According to your heart do what is right before him:
    perhaps there will be pardon for you.

    7: 
As for me, I exalt my God,
    my soul exalts the King of heaven,
    and rejoices all the days of my life.
Let all sing praise to his greatness,

    8: 
    let all speak and give thanks in Jerusalem.

    9: Jerusalem, holy city,
    he will afflict you for the works of your hands,
    but will again pity the children of the righteous.

    10: 
Give thanks to the Lord with righteousness,
    and bless the King of the ages,
    so that your tabernacle may be rebuilt in you with joy.
May he gladden within you all who are captives;
    may he cherish within you all who are distressed
    for all generations to come.

    11: 
A bright light will shine to the limits of the earth.
    Many nations will come to you from afar,
And inhabitants of all the ends of the earth
    to your holy name,
Bearing in their hands gifts for the King of heaven.
Generation after generation will offer joyful worship in you;
    your name will be great forever and ever.

    12: 
    13: 1 Then Tobit spoke and composed a song of joyful praise; he said:
Blessed be God who lives forever,
    because his kingship lasts for all ages.

    for though he has scattered you among them,
4 
    even there recount his greatness.
Exalt him before every living being,
    because he is your Lord, and he is your God,
    our Father and God forever and ever!
5 
He will afflict you for your iniquities,
    but will have mercy on all of you.
He will gather you from all the nations
    among whom you have been scattered.
6 
When you turn back to him with all your heart,
    and with all your soul do what is right before him,
Then he will turn to you,
    and will hide his face from you no longer.

    perhaps there will be pardon for you.
7 
As for me, I exalt my God,
    my soul exalts the King of heaven,
    and rejoices all the days of my life.
Let all sing praise to his greatness,
8 
    let all speak and give thanks in Jerusalem.
9 
Jerusalem, holy city,
    he will afflict you for the works of your hands,[b]
    but will again pity the children of the righteous.
10 
Give thanks to the Lord with righteousness,
    and bless the King of the ages,
    so that your tabernacle may be rebuilt in you with joy.
May he gladden within you all who are captives;
    may he cherish within you all who are distressed
    for all generations to come.
11 
A bright light will shine to the limits of the earth.
    Many nations will come to you from afar,
And inhabitants of all the ends of the earth
    to your holy name,
Bearing in their hands gifts for the King of heaven.
Generation after generation will offer joyful worship in you;
    your name will be great forever and ever.
12 
Cursed be all who despise you and revile you;
    cursed be all who hate you and speak a harsh word against you;
    cursed be all who destroy you
    and pull down your walls,
And all who overthrow your towers
    and set fire to your homes.
    But blessed forever be all those who respect you.
13 
Go, then, rejoice and exult over the children of the righteous,
    for they will all be gathered together
    and will bless the Lord of the ages.

    14: 
Happy are those who love you,
    and happy are those who rejoice in your peace.
Happy too are all who grieve
    over all your afflictions,
For they will rejoice over you
    and behold all your joy forever.

    15: 
My soul, bless the Lord, the great King;

    16: 
    for Jerusalem will be rebuilt as his house forever.
Happy too will I be if a remnant of my offspring survives
    to see your glory and to give thanks to the King of heaven!
The gates of Jerusalem will be built with sapphire and emerald,
    and all your walls with precious stones.
The towers of Jerusalem will be built with gold,
    and their battlements with purest gold.

    17: 
The streets of Jerusalem will be paved
    with rubies and stones of Ophir;

    18: 
The gates of Jerusalem will sing hymns of gladness,
    and all its houses will cry out, Hallelujah!
Blessed be the God of Israel for all ages!
For in you the blessed will bless the holy name forever and ever.


  Chapter 14.

    1: 
Parting Advice. 1 So the words of Tobit’s hymn of praise came to an end. Tobit died in peace at the age of a hundred and twelve and was buried with honor in Nineveh. 
    2: He was fifty-eight years old when he lost his eyesight, and after he recovered it he lived in prosperity, giving alms; he continued to fear God and give thanks to the divine Majesty.

    3: 
    4: Parting Advice. 1 So the words of Tobit’s hymn of praise came to an end. Tobit died in peace at the age of a hundred and twelve and was buried with honor in Nineveh. 2 He was fifty-eight years old when he lost his eyesight, and after he recovered it he lived in prosperity, giving alms; he continued to fear God and give thanks to the divine Majesty.
3 As he was dying, he summoned his son Tobiah and Tobiah’s seven sons, and commanded him, “Son, take your children 4 and flee into Media, for I believe God’s word that Nahum spoke against Nineveh. It will all happen and will overtake Assyria and Nineveh; indeed all that was said by Israel’s prophets whom God sent will come to pass. Not one of all their words will remain unfulfilled, but everything will take place in the time appointed for it. So it will be safer in Media than in Assyria or Babylon. For I know and believe that whatever God has said will be accomplished. It will happen, and not a single word of the prophecies will fail.
As for our kindred who dwell in the land of Israel, they will all be scattered and taken into captivity from the good land. All the land of Israel will become a wilderness; even Samaria and Jerusalem will be a wilderness! For a time, the house of God will be desolate and will be burned. 
    5: But God will again have mercy on them and bring them back to the land of Israel. They will build the house again, but it will not be like the first until the era when the appointed times will be completed. Afterward all of them will return from their captivity, and they will rebuild Jerusalem with due honor. In it the house of God will also be rebuilt, just as the prophets of Israel said of it. 
    6: All the nations of the world will turn and reverence God in truth; all will cast away their idols, which have deceitfully led them into error. 
    7: They will bless the God of the ages in righteousness. All the Israelites truly mindful of God, who are to be saved in those days, will be gathered together and will come to Jerusalem; in security will they dwell forever in the land of Abraham, which will be given to them. Those who love God sincerely will rejoice, but those who commit sin and wickedness will disappear completely from the land.

    8: , 
    9: Now, my children, I give you this command: serve God sincerely and do what is pleasing in his sight; you must instruct your children to do what is right and to give alms, to be mindful of God and at all times to bless his name sincerely and with all their strength. Now, as for you, son, leave Nineveh; do not stay here. 
    10: The day you bury your mother next to me, do not even stay overnight within the confines of the city. For I see that there is much wickedness in it, and much treachery is practiced in it, and people are not ashamed. See, my son, all that Nadin did to Ahiqar, the very one who reared him. Was not Ahiqar brought down alive into the earth? Yet God made Nadin’s disgraceful crime rebound against him. Ahiqar came out again into the light, but Nadin went into the everlasting darkness, for he had tried to kill Ahiqar. Because Ahiqar had given alms he escaped from the deadly trap Nadin had set for him. But Nadin fell into the deadly trap himself, and it destroyed him. 
    11: So, my children, see what almsgiving does, and also what wickedness does—it kills! But now my spirit is about to leave me.”
Death of Tobit and Tobiah. They laid him on his bed, and he died; and he was buried with honor. 
    12: When Tobiah’s mother died, he buried her next to his father. He then departed with his wife and children for Media, where he settled in Ecbatana with his father-in-law Raguel.

Death of Tobit and Tobiah. They laid him on his bed, and he died; and he was buried with honor. 12 When Tobiah’s mother died, he buried her next to his father. He then departed with his wife and children for Media, where he settled in Ecbatana with his father-in-law Raguel. 13 He took respectful care of his aging father-in-law and mother-in-law; and he buried them at Ecbatana in Media. Then he inherited Raguel’s estate as well as that of his father Tobit. 14 He died highly respected at the age of one hundred seventeen. 
    15: But before he died, he saw and heard of the destruction of Nineveh. He saw the inhabitants of the city being led captive into Media by Cyaxares, the king of Media. Tobiah blessed God for all that he had done against the Ninevites and Assyrians. Before dying he rejoiced over Nineveh, and he blessed the Lord God forever and ever.
