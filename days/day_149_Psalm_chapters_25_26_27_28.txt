To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul,
2 
    my God, in you I trust;

    do not let my enemies gloat over me.

    3: 
No one is disgraced who waits for you,

1 Of David.

To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul,
2 
    my God, in you I trust;
    do not let me be disgraced;
    do not let my enemies gloat over me.
3

    but only those who are treacherous without cause.
4 
Make known to me your ways, Lord;
    teach me your paths.
5 
Guide me by your fidelity and teach me,
    for you are God my savior,
    for you I wait all the day long.

    6: 
Remember your compassion and your mercy, O Lord,
    for they are ages old.

    7: 
Remember no more the sins of my youth;
    remember me according to your mercy,
    because of your goodness, Lord.
II

    8: 
Good and upright is the Lord,
    therefore he shows sinners the way,

    9: He guides the humble in righteousness,
    and teaches the humble his way.

    10: 
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth
    toward those who honor his covenant and decrees.

    11: 
For the sake of your name, Lord,
    pardon my guilt, though it is great.

    12: 
Who is the one who fears the Lord?
    God shows him the way he should choose.

    13: 
He will abide in prosperity,
    and his descendants will inherit the land.

    14: 
The counsel of the Lord belongs to those who fear him;
    and his covenant instructs them.

    15: 
My eyes are ever upon the Lord,
    who frees my feet from the snare.
III

    16: 
Look upon me, have pity on me,
    for I am alone and afflicted.

    17: 
Relieve the troubles of my heart;
    bring me out of my distress.

    18: 
Look upon my affliction and suffering;
    take away all my sins.

    19: 
See how many are my enemies,
    see how fiercely they hate me.

    20: 
Preserve my soul and rescue me;
    do not let me be disgraced, for in you I seek refuge.

    21: 
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me;
    I wait for you, O Lord.

    22: 
Redeem Israel, O God,
    from all its distress!

    so that I may process around your altar, Lord,

    7: 
To hear the sound of thanksgiving,
    and recount all your wondrous deeds.

    8: 
Lord, I love the refuge of your house,
    the site of the dwelling-place of your glory.
III

    9: Do not take me away with sinners,
    nor my life with the men of blood,

    10: 
In whose hands there is a plot,
    their right hands full of bribery.

    11: 
But I walk in my integrity;
    redeem me, be gracious to me!

My foot stands on level ground;

Trust in God
1 Of David.
A
I
The Lord is my light and my salvation;
    whom should I fear?
The Lord is my life’s refuge;
    of whom should I be afraid?
2 
When evildoers come at me
    to devour my flesh,[b]
These my enemies and foes
    themselves stumble and fall.

    3: 
Though an army encamp against me,
    my heart does not fear;
Though war be waged against me,
    even then do I trust.
II

    4: 
One thing I ask of the Lord;
    this I seek:
To dwell in the Lord’s house
    all the days of my life,
To gaze on the Lord’s beauty,
    to visit his temple.

    5: 
For God will hide me in his shelter
    in time of trouble,
He will conceal me in the cover of his tent;
    and set me high upon a rock.

    6: 
    7: a]
Trust in God

6 
Even now my head is held high
    above my enemies on every side!
I will offer in his tent
    sacrifices with shouts of joy;
    I will sing and chant praise to the Lord.
B
I
7 
Hear my voice, Lord, when I call;
    have mercy on me and answer me.

    8: 
“Come,” says my heart, “seek his face”;
    your face, Lord, do I seek!

    9: Do not hide your face from me;
    do not repel your servant in anger.
You are my salvation; do not cast me off;
    do not forsake me, God my savior!

    10: 
Even if my father and mother forsake me,
    the Lord will take me in.
II

    11: 
Lord, show me your way;
    lead me on a level path
    because of my enemies.

    12: 
Do not abandon me to the desire of my foes;
    malicious and lying witnesses have risen against me.

    13: 
I believe I shall see the Lord’s goodness
    in the land of the living.

    14: 
Wait for the Lord, take courage;
    be stouthearted, wait for the Lord!

Petition and Thanksgiving
1 Of David.
I
To you, Lord, I call;
    my Rock, do not be deaf to me,
Do not be silent toward me,
    so that I join those who go down to the pit.

Hear the sound of my pleading when I cry to you for help
    when I lift up my hands toward your holy place.[b]

Do not drag me off with the wicked,
    with those who do wrong,
Who speak peace to their neighbors
    though evil is in their hearts.

Repay them for their deeds,
    for the evil that they do.
For the work of their hands repay them;
    give them what they deserve.

Because they do not understand the Lord’s works,
    the work of his hands,
He will tear them down,
    never to rebuild them.
