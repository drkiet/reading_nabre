  Chapter 10.

    1: 
I
1 
Why, Lord, do you stand afar
    and pay no heed in times of trouble?

    2: 
Arrogant scoundrels pursue the poor;
    they trap them by their cunning schemes.
II

    3: 
The wicked even boast of their greed;
    these robbers curse and scorn the Lord.

    4: 
In their insolence the wicked boast:
    “God does not care; there is no God.”

    5: 
    Yet their affairs always succeed;
    they ignore your judgment on high;
    they sneer at all who oppose them.

    6: 
They say in their hearts, “We will never fall;
    never will we see misfortune.”

    7: 
Their mouths are full of oaths, violence, and lies;
    discord and evil are under their tongues.

    8: 
They wait in ambush near towns;
    their eyes watch for the helpless
    to murder the innocent in secret.

    9: 
    10: I

    never will we see misfortune.”

Their mouths are full of oaths, violence, and lies;
    discord and evil are under their tongues.
8 
They wait in ambush near towns;
    their eyes watch for the helpless
    to murder the innocent in secret.
9 
They lurk in ambush like lions in a thicket,
    hide there to trap the poor,
    snare them and close the net.
10 
The helpless are crushed, laid low;
    they fall into the power of the wicked,

    11: 
Who say in their hearts, “God has forgotten,
    shows no concern, never bothers to look.”
III

    12: 
Rise up, Lord! God, lift up your hand!
    Do not forget the poor!

    13: 
Why should the wicked scorn God,
    say in their hearts, “God does not care”?

    14: 
But you do see;
    you take note of misery and sorrow;
    you take the matter in hand.
To you the helpless can entrust their cause;
    you are the defender of orphans.

    15: 
Break the arm of the wicked and depraved;
    make them account for their crimes;
    let none of them survive.
IV

    16: 
The Lord is king forever;
    the nations have vanished from his land.

    17: 
You listen, Lord, to the needs of the poor;
    you strengthen their heart and incline your ear.

    18: 
You win justice for the orphaned and oppressed;
    no one on earth will cause terror again.

  Chapter 11.

    1: 
Confidence in the Presence of God
1 For the leader. Of David.
I
In the Lord I take refuge;
    how can you say to me,
    “Flee like a bird to the mountains!

    2: 
See how the wicked string their bows,
    fit their arrows to the string
    to shoot from the shadows at the upright of heart.

    3: 
If foundations are destroyed,
    what can the just one do?”
II

    4: 
The Lord is in his holy temple;
    the Lord’s throne is in heaven.
God’s eyes keep careful watch;
    they test the children of Adam.

    5: 
The Lord tests the righteous and the wicked,
    hates those who love violence,

    6: 
And rains upon the wicked
    fiery coals and brimstone,
    a scorching wind their allotted cup.

    7: 
The Lord is just and loves just deeds;
    the upright will see his face.


  Chapter 12.

    1: 
    2: a]
Prayer Against Evil Tongues
1 For the leader; “upon the eighth.” A psalm of David.
I
2 
Help, Lord, for no one loyal remains;
    the faithful have vanished from the children of men.

    3: 
They tell lies to one another,
    speak with deceiving lips and a double heart.
II

    4: 
May the Lord cut off all deceiving lips,
    and every boastful tongue,

    5: 
Those who say, “By our tongues we prevail;
    when our lips speak, who can lord it over us?”
III

    6: 
“Because they rob the weak, and the needy groan,
    I will now arise,” says the Lord;
    “I will grant safety to whoever longs for it.”
IV

    7: 
The promises of the Lord are sure,
    silver refined in a crucible,
    silver purified seven times.

    8: 
You, O Lord, protect us always;
    preserve us from this generation.

    9: On every side the wicked roam;
    the shameless are extolled by the children of men.
