Day 218:

Reading Isaiah, chapters ['25', '26', '27', '28']:

  Chapter 25.

    1: 
    2: 
Praise for God’s Deliverance and the Celebration in Zion
1 
O Lord, you are my God,
    I extol you, I praise your name;
For you have carried out your wonderful plans of old,
    faithful and true.
2 
For you have made the city a heap,
    the fortified city a ruin,
The castle of the insolent, a city no more,
    not ever to be rebuilt.

    3: 
Therefore a strong people will honor you,
    ruthless nations will fear you.

    4: 
    5: Praise for God’s Deliverance and the Celebration in Zion
1 
O Lord, you are my God,
    I extol you, I praise your name;
For you have carried out your wonderful plans of old,
    faithful and true.
2 
For you have made the city a heap,
    the fortified city a ruin,
The castle of the insolent, a city no more,
    not ever to be rebuilt.
3 
Therefore a strong people will honor you,
    ruthless nations will fear you.
4 
For you have been a refuge to the poor,
    a refuge to the needy in their distress;
Shelter from the rain,
    shade from the heat.
When the blast of the ruthless was like a winter rain,
5 
    the roar of strangers like heat in the desert,
You subdued the heat with the shade of a cloud,
    the rain of the tyrants was vanquished.

    6: 
On this mountain the Lord of hosts
    will provide for all peoples
A feast of rich food and choice wines,
    juicy, rich food and pure, choice wines.

    7: 
On this mountain he will destroy
    the veil that veils all peoples,
The web that is woven over all nations.

    8: 
    He will destroy death forever.
The Lord God will wipe away
    the tears from all faces;
The reproach of his people he will remove
    from the whole earth; for the Lord has spoken.

    9:     On that day it will be said:
“Indeed, this is our God; we looked to him, and he saved us!
    This is the Lord to whom we looked;
    let us rejoice and be glad that he has saved us!”
Judgment on Moab

    10: 
For the hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain,
    but Moab will be trodden down
    as straw is trodden down in the mire.

    11: 
He will spread out his hands in its midst,
    as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim;
His pride will be brought low
    despite his strokes.

    12: 
The high-walled fortress he will raze,
    bringing it low, leveling it to the ground, to the very dust.


  Chapter 26.

    1: 
    2: 
Judah’s Praise and Prayer for Deliverance. 1 On that day this song shall be sung in the land of Judah:
“A strong city[b] have we;
    he sets up victory as our walls and ramparts.
2 
Open up the gates
    that a righteous nation may enter,
    one that keeps faith.

    3: 
With firm purpose you maintain peace;
    in peace, because of our trust in you.”

    4: 
Trust in the Lord forever!
    For the Lord is an eternal Rock.

    5: 
    6: Judah’s Praise and Prayer for Deliverance. 1 On that day this song shall be sung in the land of Judah:
“A strong city[b] have we;
    he sets up victory as our walls and ramparts.
2 
Open up the gates
    that a righteous nation may enter,
    one that keeps faith.
3 
With firm purpose you maintain peace;
    in peace, because of our trust in you.”
4 
Trust in the Lord forever!
    For the Lord is an eternal Rock.
5 
He humbles those who dwell on high,
    the lofty city he brings down,
Brings it down to the ground,
    levels it to the dust.
6 
The feet of the needy trample on it—
    the feet of the poor.

    7: 
The way of the just is smooth;
    the path of the just you make level.

    8: 
The course of your judgments, Lord, we await;
    your name and your memory are the desire of our souls.

    9: My soul yearns for you at night,
    yes, my spirit within me seeks you at dawn;
When your judgment comes upon the earth,
    the world’s inhabitants learn justice.

    10: 
The wicked, when spared, do not learn justice;
    in an upright land they act perversely,
    and do not see the majesty of the Lord.

    11: 
Lord, your hand is raised high,
    but they do not perceive it;
Let them be put to shame when they see your zeal for your people:
    let the fire prepared for your enemies consume them.

    12: 
Lord, you will decree peace for us,
    for you have accomplished all we have done.

    13: 
Lord, our God, lords other than you have ruled us;
    only because of you can we call upon your name.

    14: 
Dead they are, they cannot live,
    shades that cannot rise;
Indeed, you have punished and destroyed them,
    and wiped out all memory of them.

    15: 
You have increased the nation, Lord,
    you have increased the nation, have added to your glory,
    you have extended far all the boundaries of the land.

    16: 
Lord, oppressed by your punishment,
    we cried out in anguish under your discipline.

    17: 
As a woman about to give birth
    writhes and cries out in pain,
    so were we before you, Lord.

    18: 
We conceived and writhed in pain,
    giving birth only to wind;
Salvation we have not achieved for the earth,
    no inhabitants for the world were born.

    19: 
But your dead shall live, their corpses shall rise!
    Awake and sing, you who lie in the dust!
For your dew is a dew of light,
    and you cause the land of shades to give birth.
The Lord’s Response[d]

    20: 
Go, my people, enter your chambers,
    and close the doors behind you;
Hide yourselves for a brief moment,
    until the wrath is past.

    21: 
See, the Lord goes forth from his place,
    to punish the wickedness of the earth’s inhabitants;
The earth will reveal the blood shed upon it,
    and no longer conceal the slain.


  Chapter 27.

    1: 
    2: 
The Judgment and Deliverance of Israel
1 
    On that day,
The Lord will punish with his sword
    that is cruel, great, and strong,
Leviathan the fleeing serpent,
    Leviathan the coiled serpent;
    he will slay the dragon in the sea.
2 
    [b]On that day—
The pleasant vineyard, sing about it!

    3: 
    I, the Lord, am its keeper,
    I water it every moment;
Lest anyone harm it,
    night and day I guard it.

    4: 
I am not angry.
    But if I were to find briers and thorns,
In battle I would march against it;
    I would burn it all.

    5: 
But if it holds fast to my refuge,
    it shall have peace with me;
    it shall have peace with me.

    6: 
    7: The Judgment and Deliverance of Israel
1 
    On that day,
The Lord will punish with his sword
    that is cruel, great, and strong,
Leviathan the fleeing serpent,
    Leviathan the coiled serpent;
    he will slay the dragon in the sea.
2 
    [b]On that day—
The pleasant vineyard, sing about it!
3 
    I, the Lord, am its keeper,
    I water it every moment;
Lest anyone harm it,
    night and day I guard it.
4 
I am not angry.
    But if I were to find briers and thorns,
In battle I would march against it;
    I would burn it all.
5 
But if it holds fast to my refuge,
    it shall have peace with me;
    it shall have peace with me.
6 
In days to come Jacob shall take root,
    Israel shall sprout and blossom,
    covering all the world with fruit.
7 
[c]Was he smitten as his smiter was smitten?
    Was he slain as his slayer was slain?

    8: 
Driving out and expelling, he struggled against it,
    carrying it off with his cruel wind on a day of storm.

    9: This, then, shall be the expiation of Jacob’s guilt,
    this the result of removing his sin:
He shall pulverize all the stones of the altars
    like pieces of chalk;
    no asherahs or incense altars shall stand.

    10: 
For the fortified city shall be desolate,
    an abandoned pasture, a forsaken wilderness;
There calves shall graze, there they shall lie down,
    and consume its branches.

    11: 
When its boughs wither, they shall be broken off;
    and women shall come to kindle fires with them.
For this is not an understanding people;
    therefore their maker shall not spare them;
    their creator shall not be gracious to them.

    12: 
    On that day,
The Lord shall beat out grain
    from the channel of the Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt,
    and you shall be gleaned one by one, children of Israel.

    13: 
    On that day,
A great trumpet shall blow,
    and the lost in the land of Assyria
    and the outcasts in the land of Egypt
Shall come and worship the Lord
    on the holy mountain, in Jerusalem.


  Chapter 28.

    1: 
    2: 
The Fate of Samaria
1 
Ah! majestic garland
    of the drunkards of Ephraim,[b]
Fading blooms of his glorious beauty,
    at the head of the fertile valley,
    upon those stupefied with wine.
2 
See, the Lord has a strong one, a mighty one,[c]
    who, like an onslaught of hail, a destructive storm,
Like a flood of water, great and overflowing,
    levels to the ground with violence;

    3: 
With feet that will trample
    the majestic garland of the drunkards of Ephraim.

    4: 
The fading blooms of his glorious beauty
    at the head of the fertile valley
Will be like an early fig before summer:
    whoever sees it,
    swallows it as soon as it is in hand.

    5: 
On that day the Lord of hosts
    will be a glorious crown
And a brilliant diadem
    for the remnant of his people,

    6: 
A spirit of judgment
    for the one who sits in judgment,
And strength for those
    who turn back the battle at the gate.
Against Judah

    7: 
    8: The Fate of Samaria
1 
Ah! majestic garland
    of the drunkards of Ephraim,[b]
Fading blooms of his glorious beauty,
    at the head of the fertile valley,
    upon those stupefied with wine.
2 
See, the Lord has a strong one, a mighty one,[c]
    who, like an onslaught of hail, a destructive storm,
Like a flood of water, great and overflowing,
    levels to the ground with violence;
3 
With feet that will trample
    the majestic garland of the drunkards of Ephraim.
4 
The fading blooms of his glorious beauty
    at the head of the fertile valley
Will be like an early fig before summer:
    whoever sees it,
    swallows it as soon as it is in hand.
5 
On that day the Lord of hosts
    will be a glorious crown
And a brilliant diadem
    for the remnant of his people,
6 
A spirit of judgment
    for the one who sits in judgment,
And strength for those
    who turn back the battle at the gate.
Against Judah
7 
But these also stagger from wine
    and stumble from strong drink:
Priest and prophet stagger from strong drink,
    overpowered by wine;
They are confused by strong drink,
    they stagger in their visions,
    they totter when giving judgment.
8 
Yes, all the tables
    are covered with vomit,
    with filth, and no place left clean.

    9: “To whom would he impart knowledge?
To whom would he convey the message?
To those just weaned from milk,
    those weaned from the breast?

    10: 
For he says,
‘Command on command, command on command,
    rule on rule, rule on rule,
    here a little, there a little!’”

    11: 
Yes, with stammering lips and in a strange language
    he will speak to this people,

    12: 
    to whom he said:
“This is the resting place,
    give rest to the weary;
And this is the place of repose”—
    but they refused to hear.

    13: 
So for them the word of the Lord shall be:
    “Command on command, command on command,
Rule on rule, rule on rule,
    here a little, there a little!”
So that when they walk, they shall stumble backward,
    broken, ensnared, and captured.

    14: 
Therefore, hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers,
    who rule this people in Jerusalem:

    15: 
You have declared, “We have made a covenant with death,
    with Sheol we have made a pact;
When the raging flood passes through,
    it will not reach us;
For we have made lies our refuge,
    and in falsehood we have found a hiding place,”—

    16: 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God:
    See, I am laying a stone in Zion,
    a stone that has been tested,
A precious cornerstone as a sure foundation;
    whoever puts faith in it will not waver.

    17: 
I will make judgment a measuring line,
    and justice a level.—
Hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies,
    and waters shall flood the hiding place.

    18: 
Your covenant with death shall be canceled
    and your pact with Sheol shall not stand.
When the raging flood passes through,
    you shall be beaten down by it.

    19: 
Whenever it passes, it shall seize you;
    morning after morning it shall pass,
    by day and by night.
Sheer terror
    to impart the message!

    20: 
For the bed shall be too short to stretch out in,
    and the cover too narrow to wrap in.

    21: 
For the Lord shall rise up as on Mount Perazim,
    bestir himself as in the Valley of Gibeon,
To carry out his work—strange his work!
    to perform his deed—alien his deed!

    22: 
Now, cease scoffing,
    lest your bonds be tightened,
For I have heard a decree of destruction
    from the Lord, the God of hosts,
    for the whole land.
The Parable of the Farmer

    23: 
Give ear and hear my voice,
    pay attention and hear my word:

    24: 
Is the plowman forever plowing in order to sow,
    always loosening and harrowing the field?

    25: 
When he has leveled the surface,
    does he not scatter caraway and sow cumin,
Put in wheat and barley,
    with spelt as its border?

    26: 
His God has taught him this rule,
    he has instructed him.

    27: 
    28: The Fate of Samaria
1 
Ah! majestic garland
    of the drunkards of Ephraim,[b]
Fading blooms of his glorious beauty,
    at the head of the fertile valley,
    upon those stupefied with wine.
2

    who, like an onslaught of hail, a destructive storm,
Like a flood of water, great and overflowing,
    levels to the ground with violence;
3 
With feet that will trample
    the majestic garland of the drunkards of Ephraim.
4 
The fading blooms of his glorious beauty
    at the head of the fertile valley
Will be like an early fig before summer:
    whoever sees it,
    swallows it as soon as it is in hand.
5 
On that day the Lord of hosts
    will be a glorious crown
And a brilliant diadem
    for the remnant of his people,
6 
A spirit of judgment
    for the one who sits in judgment,
And strength for those
    who turn back the battle at the gate.

[d]“To whom would he impart knowledge?

‘Command on command, command on command,

When the raging flood passes through,
    it will not reach us;
For we have made lies our refuge,
    and in falsehood we have found a hiding place,”—
16 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God:
    See, I am laying a stone in Zion,[h]
    a stone that has been tested,
A precious cornerstone as a sure foundation;
    whoever puts faith in it will not waver.
17 
I will make judgment a measuring line,
    and justice a level.—[i]
Hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies,
    and waters shall flood the hiding place.
18 
Your covenant with death shall be canceled
    and your pact with Sheol shall not stand.
When the raging flood passes through,
    you shall be beaten down by it.
19

21

To carry out his work—strange his work!
    to perform his deed—alien his deed!
22 
Now, cease scoffing,
    lest your bonds be tightened,
For I have heard a decree of destruction
    from the Lord, the God of hosts,
    for the whole land.
The Parable of the Farmer
23 
[k]Give ear and hear my voice,
    pay attention and hear my word:
24 
Is the plowman forever plowing in order to sow,
    always loosening and harrowing the field?
25 
When he has leveled the surface,
    does he not scatter caraway and sow cumin,[l]
Put in wheat and barley,
    with spelt as its border?
26 
His God has taught him this rule,
    he has instructed him.
27 
For caraway is not threshed with a sledge,
    nor does a cartwheel roll over cumin.
But caraway is beaten out with a staff,
    and cumin with a rod.
28 
Grain is crushed for bread, but not forever;
    though he thresh it thoroughly,
    and drive his cartwheel and horses over it,
    he does not pulverize it.

    29: 
This too comes from the Lord of hosts;
    wonderful is his counsel and great his wisdom.
