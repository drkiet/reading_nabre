Day 230:

Reading Jeremiah, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: 
Roam the streets of Jerusalem,
    look about and observe,
Search through her squares,
    to find even one
Who acts justly
    and seeks honesty,
    and I will pardon her!

    2: 
They say, “As the Lord lives,”
    but in fact they swear falsely.

    3: 
    Lord, do your eyes not search for honesty?
You struck them, but they did not flinch;
    you laid them low, but they refused correction;
They set their faces harder than stone,
    and refused to return.

    4: 
    5: Universal Corruption
1 
Roam the streets of Jerusalem,
    look about and observe,
Search through her squares,
    to find even one
Who acts justly
    and seeks honesty,
    and I will pardon her!
2 
They say, “As the Lord lives,”
    but in fact they swear falsely.
3 
    Lord, do your eyes not search for honesty?
You struck them, but they did not flinch;
    you laid them low, but they refused correction;
They set their faces harder than stone,
    and refused to return.
4 
I thought: These are only the lowly,
    they behave foolishly;
For they do not know the way of the Lord,
    the justice of their God.
5 
Let me go to the leaders
    and speak with them;
For they must know the way of the Lord,
    the justice of their God.
But, one and all, they have broken the yoke,
    torn off the harness.

    6: 
Therefore, lions from the forest slay them,
    wolves of the desert ravage them,
Leopards keep watch round their cities:
    all who come out are torn to pieces,
For their crimes are many,
    their rebellions numerous.

    7: 
Why should I pardon you?
    Your children have forsaken me,
    they swear by gods that are no gods.
I fed them, but they commit adultery;
    to the prostitute’s house they throng.

    8: 
They are lustful stallions,
    each neighs after the other’s wife.

    9: Should I not punish them for this?—oracle of the Lord;
    on a nation like this should I not take vengeance?

    10: 
Climb her terraces, and ravage them,
    destroy them completely.
Tear away her tendrils,
    they do not belong to the Lord.

    11: 
For they have openly rebelled against me,
    both the house of Israel and the house of Judah—
    oracle of the Lord.

    12: 
They denied the Lord,
    saying, “He is nothing,
No evil shall come to us,
    neither sword nor famine shall we see.

    13: 
The prophets are wind,
    and the word is not with them.
    Let it be done to them!”

    14: 
Therefore, thus says the Lord, the God of hosts,
    because you have said this—
See! I make my words
    a fire in your mouth,
And this people the wood
    that it shall devour!—

    15: 
Beware! I will bring against you
    a nation from far away,
    O House of Israel—oracle of the Lord;
A long-lived nation, an ancient nation,
    a people whose language you do not know,
    whose speech you cannot understand.

    16: 
Their quivers are like open graves;
    all of them are warriors.

    17: 
They will devour your harvest and your bread,
    devour your sons and your daughters,
Devour your sheep and cattle,
    devour your vines and fig trees;
With their swords they will beat down
    the fortified cities in which you trust.

    18: Yet even in those days—oracle of the Lord—I will not completely destroy you. 
    19: And when they ask, “Why has the Lord our God done all these things to us?” say to them, “As you have abandoned me to serve foreign gods in your own land, so shall you serve foreigners in a land not your own.”

    20: 
Announce this to the house of Jacob,
    proclaim it in Judah:

    21: 
Pay attention to this,
    you foolish and senseless people,
Who have eyes and do not see,
    who have ears and do not hear.

    22: 
Should you not fear me—oracle of the Lord—
    should you not tremble before me?
I made the sandy shore the sea’s limit,
    which by eternal decree it may not overstep.
Toss though it may, it is to no avail;
    though its billows roar, they cannot overstep.

    23: 
But this people’s heart is stubborn and rebellious;
    they turn and go away,

    24: 
And do not say in their hearts,
    “Let us fear the Lord, our God,
Who gives us rain
    early and late, in its time;
Who watches for us
    over the appointed weeks of harvest.”

    25: 
Your crimes have prevented these things,
    your sins have turned these blessings away from you.

    26: 
For criminals lurk among my people;
    like fowlers they set traps,
    but it is human beings they catch.

    27: 
Their houses are as full of treachery
    as a bird-cage is of birds;
Therefore they grow powerful and rich,

    28: 
    fat and sleek.
They pass over wicked deeds;
    justice they do not defend
By advancing the claim of the orphan
    or judging the cause of the poor.

    29: 
Shall I not punish these things?—oracle of the Lord;
    on a nation such as this shall I not take vengeance?

    30: 
Something shocking and horrible
    has happened in the land:

    31: 
The prophets prophesy falsely,
    and the priests teach on their own authority;
Yet my people like it this way;
    what will you do when the end comes?


  Chapter 6.

    1: 
Seek refuge, Benjaminites,
    from the midst of Jerusalem!
Blow the trumpet in Tekoa,
    raise a signal over Beth-haccherem;
For disaster threatens from the north,
    and mighty destruction.

    2: 
Lovely and delicate
    daughter Zion, you are ruined!

    3: 
Against her, shepherds come with their flocks;
    all around, they pitch their tents against her;
    each one grazes his portion.

    4: 
“Prepare for war against her,
    Up! let us rush upon her at midday!”
“Woe to us! the day is waning,
    evening shadows lengthen!”

    5: 
    6: The Enemy at the Gates
1 
Seek refuge, Benjaminites,
    from the midst of Jerusalem!
Blow the trumpet in Tekoa,
    raise a signal over Beth-haccherem;
For disaster threatens from the north,
    and mighty destruction.
2 
Lovely and delicate
    daughter Zion, you are ruined!
3 
Against her, shepherds come with their flocks;
    all around, they pitch their tents against her;
    each one grazes his portion.
4 
“Prepare for war against her,
    Up! let us rush upon her at midday!”
“Woe to us! the day is waning,
    evening shadows lengthen!”
5 
“Up! let us rush upon her by night,
    destroy her palaces!”
6 
    For thus says the Lord of hosts:
Hew down her trees,
    throw up a siege mound against Jerusalem.
Woe to the city marked for punishment;
    there is nothing but oppression within her!

    7: 
As a well keeps its waters fresh,
    so she keeps fresh her wickedness.
Violence and destruction resound in her;
    ever before me are wounds and blows.

    8: 
Be warned, Jerusalem,
    or I will be estranged from you,
And I will turn you into a wilderness,
    a land where no one dwells.

    9:     Thus says the Lord of hosts:
Glean, glean like a vine
    the remnant of Israel;
Pass your hand, like a vintager,
    repeatedly over the tendrils.

    10: 
To whom shall I speak?
    whom shall I warn, and be heard?
See! their ears are uncircumcised,
    they cannot pay attention;
See, the word of the Lord has become for them
    an object of scorn, for which they have no taste.

    11: 
But the wrath of the Lord brims up within me,
    I am weary of holding it in.
I will pour it out upon the child in the street,
    upon the young men gathered together.
Yes, husband and wife will be taken,
    elder with ancient.

    12: 
Their houses will fall to others,
    their fields and their wives as well;
For I will stretch forth my hand
    against those who dwell in the land—oracle of the Lord.

    13: 
Small and great alike, all are greedy for gain;
    prophet and priest, all practice fraud.

    14: 
They have treated lightly
    the injury to my people:
“Peace, peace!” they say,
    though there is no peace.

    15: 
They have acted shamefully, committing abominations,
    yet they are not at all ashamed,
    they do not know how to blush.
Therefore they will fall among the fallen;
    in the time of their punishment they shall stumble,
    says the Lord.

    16: 
    Thus says the Lord:
Stand by the earliest roads,
    ask the pathways of old,
“Which is the way to good?” and walk it;
    thus you will find rest for yourselves.
    But they said, “We will not walk it.”

    17: 
I raised up watchmen for them:
    “Pay attention to the sound of the trumpet!”
    But they said, “We will not pay attention!”

    18: 
Therefore hear, O nations,
    and know, O earth,
    what I will do with them:

    19: 
See, I bring evil upon this people,
    the fruit of their own schemes,
Because they did not pay attention to my words,
    because they rejected my law.

    20: 
Of what use to me is incense that comes from Sheba,
    or sweet cane from far-off lands?
Your burnt offerings find no favor with me,
    your sacrifices do not please me.

    21: 
    Therefore, thus says the Lord:
See, I will place before this people
    obstacles to trip them up;
Parents and children alike,
    neighbors and friends shall perish.

    22: 
    Thus says the Lord:
See, a people comes from the land of the north,
    a great nation, rising from the very ends of the earth.

    23: 
Bow and javelin they wield;
    cruel and pitiless are they.
They sound like the roaring sea
    as they ride forth on horses,
Each in his place for battle
    against you, daughter Zion.

    24: 
We hear news of them;
    our hands hang helpless,
Anguish takes hold of us,
    pangs like a woman in childbirth.

    25: 
Do not go out into the field,
    do not step into the street,
For the enemy has a sword;
    terror on every side!

    26: 
Daughter of my people, dress in sackcloth,
    roll in the ashes.
Mourn as for an only child
    with bitter wailing:
“How suddenly the destroyer
    comes upon us!”

    27: 
A tester for my people I have appointed you,
    to search and test their way.

    28: 
Arch-rebels are they all,
    dealers in slander,
bronze and iron, all of them,
    destroyers they are.

    29: 
The bellows are scorched,
    the lead is consumed by the fire;
In vain has the refiner refined,
    the wicked are not drawn off.

    30: 
“Silver rejected” they shall be called,
    for the Lord has rejected them.


  Chapter 7.

    1: The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 
    2: Stand at the gate of the house of the Lord and proclaim this message there: Hear the word of the Lord, all you of Judah who enter these gates to worship the Lord! 
    3: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Reform your ways and your deeds so that I may dwell with you in this place. 
    4: Do not put your trust in these deceptive words: “The temple of the Lord! The temple of the Lord! The temple of the Lord!” 
    5: Only if you thoroughly reform your ways and your deeds; if each of you deals justly with your neighbor; 
    6: 
    7: The Temple Sermon. 1 The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 2 Stand at the gate of the house of the Lord and proclaim this message there: Hear the word of the Lord, all you of Judah who enter these gates to worship the Lord! 3 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Reform your ways and your deeds so that I may dwell with you in this place. 4 Do not put your trust in these deceptive words: “The temple of the Lord! The temple of the Lord! The temple of the Lord!” 5 Only if you thoroughly reform your ways and your deeds; if each of you deals justly with your neighbor; 6 if you no longer oppress the alien,[b] the orphan, and the widow; if you no longer shed innocent blood in this place or follow after other gods to your own harm, 7 only then will I let you continue to dwell in this place, in the land I gave your ancestors long ago and forever.

    8: But look at you! You put your trust in deceptive words to your own loss! 
    9: o you think you can steal and murder, commit adultery and perjury, sacrifice to Baal, follow other gods that you do not know, 
    10: and then come and stand in my presence in this house, which bears my name, and say: “We are safe! We can commit all these abominations again!”? 
    11: Has this house which bears my name become in your eyes a den of thieves? I have seen it for myself!—oracle of the Lord. 
    12: Go to my place at Shiloh, where I made my name dwell in the beginning. See what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel. 
    13: And now, because you have committed all these deeds—oracle of the Lord—because you did not listen, though I spoke to you untiringly, and because you did not answer, though I called you, 
    14: I will do to this house, which bears my name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave you and your ancestors, exactly what I did to Shiloh. 
    15: I will cast you out of my sight, as I cast away all your kindred, all the offspring of Ephraim.
Abuses in Worship. 
    16: You, now, must not intercede for this people! Do not raise a cry or prayer in their behalf! Do not press me, for I will not listen to you! 
    17: Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah, in the streets of Jerusalem? 
    18: The children gather wood, their fathers light the fire, and the women knead dough to make cakes for the Queen of Heaven, while libations are poured out to other gods—all to offend me! 
    19: Are they really offending me—oracle of the Lord—or rather themselves, to their own disgrace? 
    20: Therefore, thus says the Lord God: my anger and my wrath will pour out upon this place, upon human being and beast, upon the trees of the field and the fruits of the earth; it will burn and not be quenched.

    21: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Heap your burnt offerings upon your sacrifices; eat up the meat! 
    22: In speaking to your ancestors on the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I gave them no command concerning burnt offering or sacrifice. 
    23: This rather is what I commanded them: Listen to my voice; then I will be your God and you shall be my people. Walk exactly in the way I command you, so that you may prosper.

    24: But they did not listen to me, nor did they pay attention. They walked in the stubbornness of their evil hearts and turned their backs, not their faces, to me. 
    25: From the day that your ancestors left the land of Egypt even to this day, I kept on sending all my servants the prophets to you. 
    26: Yet they have not listened to me nor have they paid attention; they have stiffened their necks and done worse than their ancestors. 
    27: When you speak all these words to them, they will not listen to you either. When you call to them, they will not answer you. 
    28: Say to them: This is the nation which does not listen to the voice of the Lord, its God, or take correction. Faithfulness has disappeared; the word itself is banished from their speech.

    29: 
Cut off your hair and throw it away!
    on the heights raise a lament;
The Lord has indeed rejected and cast off
    the generation that draws down his wrath.

    30: The people of Judah have done what is evil in my eyes—oracle of the Lord. They have set up their detestable things in the house which bears my name, thereby defiling it. 
    31: In the Valley of Ben-hinnom they go on building the high places of Topheth to sacrifice their sons and daughters by fire, something I never commanded or considered. 
    32: Be assured! Days are coming—oracle of the Lord—when they will no longer say “Topheth” or “Valley of Ben-hinnom” but “Valley of Slaughter.” For want of space, Topheth will become burial ground. 
    33: The corpses of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and beasts of the earth, which no one will drive away. 
    34: I will silence the cry of joy, the cry of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for the land will be turned to rubble.


  Chapter 8.

    1: At that time—oracle of the Lord—the bones of the kings and princes of Judah, the bones of the priests and the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will be brought out of their graves 
    2: and spread out before the sun, the moon, and the whole host of heaven, which they loved and served, which they followed, consulted, and worshiped. They will not be gathered up for burial, but will lie like dung upon the ground. 
    3: Death will be preferred to life by all the survivors of this wicked people who remain in any of the places to which I banish them—oracle of the Lord of hosts.
Israel’s Conduct Incomprehensible

    4: 
    Tell them: Thus says the Lord:
When someone falls, do they not rise again?
    if they turn away, do they not turn back?

    5: 
Why then do these people resist
    with persistent rebellion?
Why do they cling to deception,
    refuse to turn back?

    6: 
I have listened closely:
    they speak what is not true;
No one regrets wickedness,
    saying, “What have I done?”
Everyone keeps on running their course,
    like a horse dashing into battle.

    7: 
    8: 1 At that time—oracle of the Lord—the bones of the kings and princes of Judah, the bones of the priests and the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will be brought out of their graves 2 and spread out before the sun, the moon, and the whole host of heaven, which they loved and served, which they followed, consulted, and worshiped. They will not be gathered up for burial, but will lie like dung upon the ground. 3 Death will be preferred to life by all the survivors of this wicked people who remain in any of the places to which I banish them—oracle of the Lord of hosts.
Israel’s Conduct Incomprehensible
4 
    Tell them: Thus says the Lord:
When someone falls, do they not rise again?
    if they turn away, do they not turn back?
5 
Why then do these people resist
    with persistent rebellion?
Why do they cling to deception,
    refuse to turn back?
6 
I have listened closely:
    they speak what is not true;
No one regrets wickedness,
    saying, “What have I done?”
Everyone keeps on running their course,
    like a horse dashing into battle.
7 
Even the stork in the sky
    knows its seasons;
Turtledove, swift, and thrush
    observe the time of their return,
But my people do not know
    the order of the Lord.
8 
How can you say, “We are wise,
    we have the law of the Lord”?
See, that has been changed into falsehood
    by the lying pen of the scribes![b]

    9: The wise are put to shame,
    terrified, and trapped;
Since they have rejected the word of the Lord,
    what sort of wisdom do they have?
Shameless in Their Crimes

    10: 
Therefore, I will give their wives to other men,
    their fields to new owners.
Small and great alike, all are greedy for gain,
    prophet and priest, all practice fraud.

    11: 
They have treated lightly
    the injury to the daughter of my people:
“Peace, peace!” they say,
    though there is no peace.

    12: 
They have acted shamefully; they have done abominable things,
    yet they are not at all ashamed,
    they do not know how to blush.
Hence they shall be among those who fall;
    in their time of punishment they shall stumble,
    says the Lord.
Threats of Punishment

    13: 
I will gather them all in—oracle of the Lord:
    no grapes on the vine,
No figs on the fig trees,
    foliage withered!
Whatever I have given them is gone.

    14: 
Why do we remain here?
    Let us assemble and flee to the fortified cities,
    where we will meet our doom;
For the Lord our God has doomed us,
    he has given us poisoned water to drink,
    because we have sinned against the Lord.

    15: 
We wait for peace to no avail;
    for a time of healing, but terror comes instead.

    16: 
From Dan is heard
    the snorting of horses;
The neighing of stallions
    shakes the whole land.
They come to devour the land and everything in it,
    the city and its inhabitants.

    17: 
Yes, I will send against you
    poisonous snakes.
Against them no charm will work
    when they bite you—oracle of the Lord.
The Prophet’s Grief over the People’s Suffering

    18: 
My joy is gone,
    grief is upon me,
    my heart is sick.

    19: 
Listen! the cry of the daughter of my people,
    far and wide in the land!
“Is the Lord no longer in Zion,
    is her King no longer in her midst?”
Why do they provoke me with their idols,
    with their foreign nonentities?

    20: 
“The harvest is over, the summer ended,
    but we have not yet been saved!”

    21: 
I am broken by the injury of the daughter of my people.
    I am in mourning; horror has seized me.

    22: 
Is there no balm in Gilead,
    no healer there?
Why does new flesh not grow
    over the wound of the daughter of my people?

    23: 
Oh, that my head were a spring of water,
    my eyes a fountain of tears,
That I might weep day and night
    over the slain from the daughter of my people!


End of day 230.
