Day 182:

Reading Proverbs, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: 
My son, to my wisdom be attentive,
    to understanding incline your ear,

    2: 
That you may act discreetly,
    and your lips guard what you know.

    3: 
Indeed, the lips of the stranger drip honey,
    and her mouth is smoother than oil;

    4: 
    5: Warning Against Adultery
1 
My son, to my wisdom be attentive,
    to understanding incline your ear,
2 
That you may act discreetly,
    and your lips guard what you know.
3 
Indeed, the lips of the stranger drip honey,[b]
    and her mouth is smoother than oil;
4 
But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,
    as sharp as a two-edged sword.
5 
Her feet go down to death,
    her steps reach Sheol;

    6: 
Her paths ramble, you know not where,
    lest you see before you the road to life.

    7: 
So now, children, listen to me,
    do not stray from the words of my mouth.

    8: 
Keep your way far from her,
    do not go near the door of her house,

    9: Lest you give your honor to others,
    and your years to a merciless one;

    10: 
Lest outsiders take their fill of your wealth,
    and your hard-won earnings go to another’s house;

    11: 
And you groan in the end,
    when your flesh and your body are consumed;

    12: 
And you say, “Oh, why did I hate instruction,
    and my heart spurn reproof!

    13: 
Why did I not listen to the voice of my teachers,
    incline my ear to my instructors!

    14: 
I am all but ruined,
    in the midst of the public assembly!”

    15: 
Drink water from your own cistern,
    running water from your own well.

    16: 
Should your water sources be dispersed abroad,
    streams of water in the streets?

    17: 
Let them be yours alone,
    not shared with outsiders;

    18: 
Let your fountain be blessed and have joy of the wife of your youth,

    19: 
    your lovely hind, your graceful doe.
Of whose love you will ever have your fill,
    and by her ardor always be intoxicated.

    20: 
Why then, my son, should you be intoxicated with a stranger,
    and embrace another woman?

    21: 
Indeed, the ways of each person are plain to the Lord’s sight;
    all their paths he surveys;

    22: 
By their own iniquities the wicked will be caught,
    in the meshes of their own sin they will be held fast;

    23: 
They will die from lack of discipline,
    lost because of their great folly.


  Chapter 6.

    1: 
My son, if you have become surety to your neighbor,
    given your hand in pledge to another,

    2: 
You have been snared by the utterance of your lips,
    caught by the words of your mouth;

    3: 
So do this, my son, to free yourself,
    since you have fallen into your neighbor’s power:
Go, hurry, rouse your neighbor!

    4: 
Give no sleep to your eyes,
    nor slumber to your eyelids;

    5: 
    6: Miscellaneous Proverbs
Against Going Surety for One’s Neighbor
1 
[b]My son, if you have become surety to your neighbor,
    given your hand in pledge to another,
2 
You have been snared by the utterance of your lips,
    caught by the words of your mouth;
3 
So do this, my son, to free yourself,
    since you have fallen into your neighbor’s power:
Go, hurry, rouse your neighbor!
4 
Give no sleep to your eyes,
    nor slumber to your eyelids;
5 
Free yourself like a gazelle from the hunter,
    or like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
The Ant and the Sluggard at Harvest
6 
[c]Go to the ant, O sluggard,
    study her ways and learn wisdom;

    7: 
For though she has no chief,
    no commander or ruler,

    8: 
She procures her food in the summer,
    stores up her provisions in the harvest.

    9: How long, O sluggard, will you lie there?
    when will you rise from your sleep?

    10: 
A little sleep, a little slumber,
    a little folding of the arms to rest—

    11: 
Then poverty will come upon you like a robber,
    and want like a brigand.
The Scoundrel

    12: 
Scoundrels, villains, are they
    who deal in crooked talk.

    13: 
Shifty of eye,
    feet ever moving,
    pointing with fingers,

    14: 
They have perversity in their hearts,
    always plotting evil,
    sowing discord.

    15: 
Therefore their doom comes suddenly;
    in an instant they are crushed beyond cure.
What the Lord Rejects

    16: 
There are six things the Lord hates,
    yes, seven are an abomination to him;

    17: 
Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
    hands that shed innocent blood,

    18: 
A heart that plots wicked schemes,
    feet that are quick to run to evil,

    19: 
The false witness who utters lies,
    and the one who sows discord among kindred.
Warning Against Adultery

    20: 
Observe, my son, your father’s command,
    and do not reject your mother’s teaching;

    21: 
Keep them fastened over your heart always,
    tie them around your neck.

    22: 
When you lie down they will watch over you,
    when you wake, they will share your concerns;
    wherever you turn, they will guide you.

    23: 
For the command is a lamp, and the teaching a light,
    and a way to life are the reproofs that discipline,

    24: 
Keeping you from another’s wife,
    from the smooth tongue of the foreign woman.

    25: 
Do not lust in your heart after her beauty,
    do not let her captivate you with her glance!

    26: 
For the price of a harlot
    may be scarcely a loaf of bread,
But a married woman
    is a trap for your precious life.

    27: 
Can a man take embers into his bosom,
    and his garments not be burned?

    28: 
Or can a man walk on live coals,
    and his feet not be scorched?

    29: 
So with him who sleeps with another’s wife—
    none who touches her shall go unpunished.

    30: 
Thieves are not despised
    if out of hunger they steal to satisfy their appetite.

    31: 
Yet if caught they must pay back sevenfold,
    yield up all the wealth of their house.

    32: 
But those who commit adultery have no sense;
    those who do it destroy themselves.

    33: 
They will be beaten and disgraced,
    and their shame will not be wiped away;

    34: 
For passion enrages the husband,
    he will have no pity on the day of vengeance;

    35: 
He will not consider any restitution,
    nor be satisfied by your many bribes.


  Chapter 7.

    1: 
My son, keep my words,
    and treasure my commands.

    2: 
Keep my commands and live,
    and my teaching as the apple of your eye;

    3: 
Bind them on your fingers,
    write them on the tablet of your heart.

    4: 
Say to Wisdom, “You are my sister!”
    Call Understanding, “Friend!”

    5: 
That they may keep you from a stranger,
    from the foreign woman with her smooth words.

    6: 
    7: The Seduction
1 
[b]My son, keep my words,
    and treasure my commands.
2 
Keep my commands and live,[c]
    and my teaching as the apple of your eye;
3 
Bind them on your fingers,
    write them on the tablet of your heart.
4 
Say to Wisdom, “You are my sister!”[d]
    Call Understanding, “Friend!”
5 
That they may keep you from a stranger,
    from the foreign woman with her smooth words.
6 
For at the window of my house,
    through my lattice I looked out[e]
7 
And I saw among the naive,
    I observed among the young men,
    a youth with no sense,

    8: 
Crossing the street near the corner,
    then walking toward her house,

    9: In the twilight, at dusk of day,
    in the very dark of night.

    10: 
Then the woman comes to meet him,
    dressed like a harlot, with secret designs.

    11: 
She is raucous and unruly,
    her feet cannot stay at home;

    12: 
Now she is in the streets, now in the open squares,
    lurking in ambush at every corner.

    13: 
Then she grabs him, kisses him,
    and with an impudent look says to him:

    14: 
“I owed peace offerings,
    and today I have fulfilled my vows;

    15: 
So I came out to meet you,
    to look for you, and I have found you!

    16: 
With coverlets I have spread my couch,
    with brocaded cloths of Egyptian linen;

    17: 
I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh,
    with aloes, and with cinnamon.

    18: 
Come, let us drink our fill of love,
    until morning, let us feast on love!

    19: 
For my husband is not at home,
    he has gone on a long journey;

    20: 
A bag of money he took with him,
    he will not return home till the full moon.”

    21: 
She wins him over by repeated urging,
    with her smooth lips she leads him astray.

    22: 
He follows her impulsively,
    like an ox that goes to slaughter;
Like a stag that bounds toward the net,

    23: 
    till an arrow pierces its liver;
Like a bird that rushes into a snare,
    unaware that his life is at stake.

    24: 
So now, children, listen to me,
    be attentive to the words of my mouth!

    25: 
Do not let your heart turn to her ways,
    do not go astray in her paths;

    26: 
For many are those she has struck down dead,
    numerous, those she has slain.

    27: 
Her house is a highway to Sheol,
    leading down into the chambers of death.


  Chapter 8.

    1: 
Does not Wisdom call,
    and Understanding raise her voice?

    2: 
On the top of the heights along the road,
    at the crossroads she takes her stand;

    3: 
By the gates at the approaches of the city,
    in the entryways she cries aloud:

    4: 
“To you, O people, I call;
    my appeal is to you mortals.

    5: 
You naive ones, gain prudence,
    you fools, gain sense.

    6: 
Listen! for noble things I speak;
    my lips proclaim honest words.

    7: 
    8: The Discourse of Wisdom
1 
Does not Wisdom call,
    and Understanding raise her voice?
2 
On the top of the heights along the road,
    at the crossroads she takes her stand;
3 
By the gates at the approaches of the city,
    in the entryways she cries aloud:
4 
“To you, O people, I call;
    my appeal is to you mortals.
5 
You naive ones, gain prudence,
    you fools,[b] gain sense.
6 
Listen! for noble things I speak;
    my lips proclaim honest words.
7 
[c]Indeed, my mouth utters truth,
    and my lips abhor wickedness.
8 
All the words of my mouth are sincere,
    none of them wily or crooked;

    9: All of them are straightforward to the intelligent,
    and right to those who attain knowledge.

    10: 
Take my instruction instead of silver,
    and knowledge rather than choice gold.

    11: 


    12: 
I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence,
    and useful knowledge I have.

    13: 

Pride, arrogance, the evil way,
    and the perverse mouth I hate.

    14: 
Mine are counsel and advice;
    Mine is strength; I am understanding.

    15: 
By me kings reign,
    and rulers enact justice;

    16: 
By me princes govern,
    and nobles, all the judges of the earth.

    17: 
Those who love me I also love,
    and those who seek me find me.

    18: 
With me are riches and honor,
    wealth that endures, and righteousness.

    19: 
My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold,
    and my yield than choice silver.

    20: 
On the way of righteousness I walk,
    along the paths of justice,

    21: 
Granting wealth to those who love me,
    and filling their treasuries.

    22: 
“The Lord begot me, the beginning of his works,
    the forerunner of his deeds of long ago;

    23: 
From of old I was formed,
    at the first, before the earth.

    24: 
When there were no deeps I was brought forth,
    when there were no fountains or springs of water;

    25: 
Before the mountains were settled into place,
    before the hills, I was brought forth;

    26: 
When the earth and the fields were not yet made,
    nor the first clods of the world.

    27: 
When he established the heavens, there was I,
    when he marked out the vault over the face of the deep;

    28: 
When he made firm the skies above,
    when he fixed fast the springs of the deep;

    29: 
When he set for the sea its limit,
    so that the waters should not transgress his command;
When he fixed the foundations of earth,

    30: 
    then was I beside him as artisan;
I was his delight day by day,
    playing before him all the while,

    31: 
Playing over the whole of his earth,
    having my delight with human beings.

    32: 
Now, children, listen to me;
    happy are they who keep my ways.

    33: 
Listen to instruction and grow wise,
    do not reject it!

    34: 
Happy the one who listens to me,
    attending daily at my gates,
    keeping watch at my doorposts;

    35: 
For whoever finds me finds life,
    and wins favor from the Lord;

    36: 
But those who pass me by do violence to themselves;
    all who hate me love death.”
