Day 200:

Reading Ben-Sira, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: 
Do not rely on your wealth,
    or say, “I have the power.”

    2: 
Do not rely on your strength
    in following the desires of your heart.

    3: 
Do not say, “Who can prevail against me?”
    for the Lord will exact punishment.

    4: 
    5: Against Presumption
1 
Do not rely on your wealth,
    or say, “I have the power.”
2 
Do not rely on your strength
    in following the desires of your heart.
3 
Do not say, “Who can prevail against me?”
    for the Lord will exact punishment.
4 
Do not say, “I have sinned, yet what has happened to me?”
    for the Lord is slow to anger!
5 
Do not be so confident of forgiveness
    that you add sin upon sin.

    6: 
Do not say, “His mercy is great;
    my many sins he will forgive.”
For mercy and anger alike are with him;
    his wrath comes to rest on the wicked.

    7: 
Do not delay turning back to the Lord,
    do not put it off day after day.
For suddenly his wrath will come forth;
    at the time of vengeance, you will perish.

    8: 
Do not rely on deceitful wealth,
    for it will be no help on the day of wrath.
Use and Abuse of the Tongue

    9: Do not winnow in every wind,
    nor walk in every path.

    10: 
Be steadfast regarding your knowledge,
    and let your speech be consistent.

    11: 
Be swift to hear,
    but slow to answer.

    12: 
If you can, answer your neighbor;
    if not, place your hand over your mouth!

    13: 
Honor and dishonor through speaking!
    The tongue can be your downfall.

    14: 
Do not be called double-tongued;
    and with your tongue do not slander a neighbor.
For shame has been created for the thief,
    and sore disgrace for the double-tongued.

    15: 
In little or in much, do not act corruptly;


  Chapter 6.

    1: 
    Do not be a foe instead of a friend.
A bad name, disgrace, and dishonor you will inherit.
    Thus the wicked, the double-tongued!
Unruly Passions

    2: 
Do not fall into the grip of your passion,
    lest like fire it consume your strength.

    3: 
It will eat your leaves and destroy your fruits,
    and you will be left like a dry tree.

    4: 
For fierce passion destroys its owner
    and makes him the sport of his enemies.
True Friendship

    5: 
    6: 1 
    Do not be a foe instead of a friend.
A bad name, disgrace, and dishonor you will inherit.
    Thus the wicked, the double-tongued!
Unruly Passions
2 
Do not fall into the grip of your passion,
    lest like fire it consume your strength.
3 
It will eat your leaves and destroy your fruits,
    and you will be left like a dry tree.
4 
For fierce passion destroys its owner
    and makes him the sport of his enemies.
True Friendship[b]
5 
Pleasant speech multiplies friends,
    and gracious lips, friendly greetings.
6 
Let those who are friendly to you be many,
    but one in a thousand your confidant.

    7: 
When you gain friends, gain them through testing,
    and do not be quick to trust them.

    8: 
For there are friends when it suits them,
    but they will not be around in time of trouble.

    9: Another is a friend who turns into an enemy,
    and tells of the quarrel to your disgrace.

    10: 
Others are friends, table companions,
    but they cannot be found in time of affliction.

    11: 
When things go well, they are your other self,
    and lord it over your servants.

    12: 
If disaster comes upon you, they turn against you
    and hide themselves.

    13: 
Stay away from your enemies,
    and be on guard with your friends.

    14: 
Faithful friends are a sturdy shelter;
    whoever finds one finds a treasure.

    15: 
Faithful friends are beyond price,
    no amount can balance their worth.

    16: 
Faithful friends are life-saving medicine;
    those who fear God will find them.

    17: 
Those who fear the Lord enjoy stable friendship,
    for as they are, so will their neighbors be.
Blessings of Wisdom

    18: 
My child, from your youth choose discipline;
    and when you have gray hair you will find wisdom.

    19: 
As though plowing and sowing, draw close to her;
    then wait for her bountiful crops.
For in cultivating her you will work but little,
    and soon you will eat her fruit.

    20: 
She is rough ground to the fool!
    The stupid cannot abide her.

    21: 
She will be like a burdensome stone to them,
    and they will not delay in casting her aside.

    22: 
For discipline is like her name,
    she is not accessible to many.

    23: 
Listen, my child, and take my advice;
    do not refuse my counsel.

    24: 
Put your feet into her fetters,
    and your neck under her yoke.

    25: 
Bend your shoulders and carry her
    and do not be irked at her bonds.

    26: 
With all your soul draw close to her;
    and with all your strength keep her ways.

    27: 
Inquire and search, seek and find;
    when you get hold of her, do not let her go.

    28: 
Thus at last you will find rest in her,
    and she will become your joy.

    29: 
Her fetters will be a place of strength;
    her snare, a robe of spun gold.

    30: 
Her yoke will be a gold ornament;
    her bonds, a purple cord.

    31: 
You will wear her as a robe of glory,
    and bear her as a splendid crown.

    32: 
If you wish, my son, you can be wise;
    if you apply yourself, you can be shrewd.

    33: 
If you are willing to listen, you can learn;
    if you pay attention, you can be instructed.

    34: 
Stand in the company of the elders;
    stay close to whoever is wise.

    35: 
Be eager to hear every discourse;
    let no insightful saying escape you.

    36: 
If you see the intelligent, seek them out;
    let your feet wear away their doorsteps!

    37: 
Reflect on the law of the Most High,
    and let his commandments be your constant study.
Then he will enlighten your mind,
    and make you wise as you desire.

Do you have sons? Correct them
    and cure their stubbornness in their early youth.

Give your daughter in marriage, and a worry comes to an end;
    but give her to a sensible man.

    26: 
Do you have a wife? Do not mistreat her,
    but do not trust the wife you hate.

    27: 
With your whole heart honor your father;
    your mother’s birth pangs do not forget.

Remember, of these parents you were born;
    what can you give them for all they gave you?

    29: 
With all your soul fear God
    and revere his priests.

    30: 
With all your strength love your Maker
    and do not neglect his ministers.

Honor God and respect the priest;

First fruits and contributions,
    his portion of victims and holy offerings.

To the poor also extend your hand,
    that your blessing may be complete.

In whatever you do, remember your last days,
    and you will never sin.

Do not contend with the mighty,
    lest you fall into their power.

Do not rejoice when someone dies;
    remember, we are all to be gathered in.
8 
Do not neglect the discourse of the wise,
    but busy yourself with their proverbs;
For in this way you will acquire the training
    to stand in the presence of princes.

    9: Do not reject the tradition of the elders
    which they have heard from their ancestors;

Do not go to court against a judge,
    for the case will be settled in his favor.

    15: 
Do not travel with the ruthless
    lest they weigh you down with calamity;
For they will only go their own way,
    and through their folly you will also perish.

    16: 
Do not defy the quick-tempered,
    or ride with them through the desert.
For bloodshed is nothing to them;
    when there is no one to help, they will destroy you.

    17: 
Do not take counsel with simpletons,
    for they cannot keep a confidence.

    18: 
Before a stranger do nothing that should be kept secret,
    for you do not know what it will produce later on.

    19: 
Open your heart to no one,
    do not banish your happiness.
