Day 168:

Reading Psalm, chapters ['101', '102', '103', '104']:

  Chapter 101.

    1: 1
Norm of Life for Rulers
1 A psalm of David.
I
I sing of mercy and justice;
    to you, Lord, I sing praise.

    2: 
I study the way of integrity;
    when will you come to me?
I act with integrity of heart
    within my household.

    3: 
I do not allow into my presence anything base.
    I hate wrongdoing;
    I will have no part of it.

    4: 
May the devious heart keep far from me;
    the wicked I will not acknowledge.

    5: 
Whoever slanders a neighbor in secret
    I will reduce to silence.
Haughty eyes and arrogant hearts
    I cannot endure.
II

    6: 
I look to the faithful of the land
    to sit at my side.
Whoever follows the way of integrity
    is the one to enter my service.

    7: 
No one who practices deceit
    can remain within my house.
No one who speaks falsely
    can last in my presence.

    8: 
Morning after morning I clear all the wicked from the land,
    to rid the city of the Lord of all doers of evil.


  Chapter 102.

    1: 
    2: a]
Prayer in Time of Distress
1 The prayer of one afflicted and wasting away whose anguish is poured out before the Lord.
I
2 
Lord, hear my prayer;
    let my cry come to you.

    3: 
Do not hide your face from me
    in the day of my distress.
Turn your ear to me;
    when I call, answer me quickly.

    4: 
For my days vanish like smoke;
    my bones burn away as in a furnace.

    5: 
My heart is withered, dried up like grass,
    too wasted to eat my food.

    6: 
From my loud groaning
    I become just skin and bones.

    7: 
I am like a desert owl,
    like an owl among the ruins.

    8: 
I lie awake and moan,
    like a lone sparrow on the roof.

    9: 
    10: 
Prayer in Time of Distress
1 The prayer of one afflicted and wasting away whose anguish is poured out before the Lord.
I
2 
Lord, hear my prayer;
    let my cry come to you.
3 
Do not hide your face from me
    in the day of my distress.
Turn your ear to me;
    when I call, answer me quickly.
4 
For my days vanish like smoke;
    my bones burn away as in a furnace.
5 
My heart is withered, dried up like grass,
    too wasted to eat my food.
6 
From my loud groaning
    I become just skin and bones.
7 
I am like a desert owl,
    like an owl among the ruins.
8 
I lie awake and moan,
    like a lone sparrow on the roof.
9 
All day long my enemies taunt me;
    in their rage, they make my name a curse.[b]
10 
I eat ashes like bread,
    mingle my drink with tears.

    11: 
Because of your furious wrath,
    you lifted me up just to cast me down.

    12: 
My days are like a lengthening shadow;
    I wither like the grass.
II

    13: 
But you, Lord, are enthroned forever;
    your renown is for all generations.

    14: 
You will again show mercy to Zion;
    now is the time for pity;
    the appointed time has come.

    15: 
Its stones are dear to your servants;
    its dust moves them to pity.

    16: 
The nations shall fear your name, Lord,
    all the kings of the earth, your glory,

    17: 
Once the Lord has rebuilt Zion
    and appeared in glory,

    18: 
Heeding the plea of the lowly,
    not scorning their prayer.

    19: 
Let this be written for the next generation,
    for a people not yet born,
    that they may praise the Lord:

    20: 
“The Lord looked down from the holy heights,
    viewed the earth from heaven,

    21: 
To attend to the groaning of the prisoners,
    to release those doomed to die.”

    22: 
Then the Lord’s name will be declared on Zion,
    his praise in Jerusalem,

    23: 
When peoples and kingdoms gather
    to serve the Lord.
III

    24: 
He has shattered my strength in mid-course,
    has cut short my days.

    25: 
I plead, O my God,
    do not take me in the midst of my days.
    Your years last through all generations.

    26: 
Of old you laid the earth’s foundations;
    the heavens are the work of your hands.

    27: 
They perish, but you remain;
    they all wear out like a garment;
Like clothing you change them and they are changed,

    28: 
    but you are the same, your years have no end.

    29: 
May the children of your servants live on;
    may their descendants live in your presence.


  Chapter 103.

Praise of Divine Goodness
1 Of David.

1 Of David.
I
Bless the Lord, my soul;
    all my being, bless his holy name!
2 
Bless the Lord, my soul;
    and do not forget all his gifts,
3 
Who pardons all your sins,
    and heals all your ills,

    4: 
Who redeems your life from the pit,
    and crowns you with mercy and compassion,

    5: 
Who fills your days with good things,
    so your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
II

    6: 
The Lord does righteous deeds,
    brings justice to all the oppressed.

    7: 
He made known his ways to Moses,
    to the Israelites his deeds.

    8: 
Merciful and gracious is the Lord,
    slow to anger, abounding in mercy.

    9:

7 
He made known his ways to Moses,
    to the Israelites his deeds.
8 
Merciful and gracious is the Lord,
    slow to anger, abounding in mercy.
9 
He will not always accuse,
    and nurses no lasting anger;
10 
He has not dealt with us as our sins merit,
    nor requited us as our wrongs deserve.
III

    11: 
For as the heavens tower over the earth,
    so his mercy towers over those who fear him.

    12: 
As far as the east is from the west,
    so far has he removed our sins from us.

    13: 
As a father has compassion on his children,
    so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.

    14: 
For he knows how we are formed,
    remembers that we are dust.

    15: 
As for man, his days are like the grass;
    he blossoms like a flower in the field.

    16: 
A wind sweeps over it and it is gone;
    its place knows it no more.

    17: 
But the Lord’s mercy is from age to age,
    toward those who fear him.
His salvation is for the children’s children

    18: 
    of those who keep his covenant,
    and remember to carry out his precepts.
IV

    19: 
The Lord has set his throne in heaven;
    his dominion extends over all.

    20: 
Bless the Lord, all you his angels,
    mighty in strength, acting at his behest,
    obedient to his command.

    21: 
Bless the Lord, all you his hosts,
    his ministers who carry out his will.

    22: 
Bless the Lord, all his creatures,
    everywhere in his domain.
    Bless the Lord, my soul!

Praise of God the Creator
I
1 
Bless the Lord, my soul!
    Lord, my God, you are great indeed!
You are clothed with majesty and splendor,

    2: 
    robed in light as with a cloak.
You spread out the heavens like a tent;

    3:

Praise of God the Creator
I
1 
Bless the Lord, my soul!
    Lord, my God, you are great indeed!
You are clothed with majesty and splendor,
2 
    robed in light as with a cloak.
You spread out the heavens like a tent;
3 
    setting the beams of your chambers upon the waters.[b]
You make the clouds your chariot;
    traveling on the wings of the wind.
4 
You make the winds your messengers;
    flaming fire, your ministers.
II

    5: 
You fixed the earth on its foundation,
    so it can never be shaken.

    6: 
The deeps covered it like a garment;
    above the mountains stood the waters.

    7: 
At your rebuke they took flight;
    at the sound of your thunder they fled.

    8: 
They rushed up the mountains, down the valleys
    to the place you had fixed for them.

    9: 
    10: 
Praise of God the Creator
I
1 
Bless the Lord, my soul!
    Lord, my God, you are great indeed!

    flaming fire, your ministers.
II
5 
[c]You fixed the earth on its foundation,
    so it can never be shaken.
6 
The deeps covered it like a garment;
    above the mountains stood the waters.
7 
At your rebuke they took flight;
    at the sound of your thunder they fled.
8 
They rushed up the mountains, down the valleys
    to the place you had fixed for them.
9 
You set a limit they cannot pass;
    never again will they cover the earth.
III
10 
You made springs flow in wadies
    that wind among the mountains.

    11: 
They give drink to every beast of the field;
    here wild asses quench their thirst.

    12: 
Beside them the birds of heaven nest;
    among the branches they sing.

    13: 
You water the mountains from your chambers;
    from the fruit of your labor the earth abounds.

    14: 
You make the grass grow for the cattle
    and plants for people’s work
    to bring forth food from the earth,

    15: 
wine to gladden their hearts,
    oil to make their faces shine,
    and bread to sustain the human heart.

    16: 
The trees of the Lord drink their fill,
    the cedars of Lebanon, which you planted.

    17: 
There the birds build their nests;
    the stork in the junipers, its home.

    18: 
The high mountains are for wild goats;
    the rocky cliffs, a refuge for badgers.
IV

    19: 
You made the moon to mark the seasons,
    the sun that knows the hour of its setting.

    20: 
You bring darkness and night falls,
    then all the animals of the forest wander about.

    21: 
Young lions roar for prey;
    they seek their food from God.

    22: 
When the sun rises, they steal away
    and settle down in their dens.

    23: 
People go out to their work,
    to their labor till evening falls.
V

    24: 
How varied are your works, Lord!
    In wisdom you have made them all;
    the earth is full of your creatures.

    25: 
There is the sea, great and wide!
    It teems with countless beings,
    living things both large and small.

    26: 
There ships ply their course
    and Leviathan, whom you formed to play with.
VI

    27: 
All of these look to you
    to give them food in due time.

    28: 
When you give it to them, they gather;
    when you open your hand, they are well filled.

    29: 
When you hide your face, they panic.
    Take away their breath, they perish
    and return to the dust.

    30: 
Send forth your spirit, they are created
    and you renew the face of the earth.
VII

    31: 
May the glory of the Lord endure forever;
    may the Lord be glad in his works!

    32: 
Who looks at the earth and it trembles,
    touches the mountains and they smoke!

    33: 
I will sing to the Lord all my life;
    I will sing praise to my God while I live.

    34: 
May my meditation be pleasing to him;
    I will rejoice in the Lord.

    35: 
May sinners vanish from the earth,
    and the wicked be no more.
Bless the Lord, my soul! Hallelujah!
