Reading Psalm, chapters ['141', '142', '143', '144']:

  Chapter 141.

    1: 1
Prayer for Deliverance from the Wicked
1 A psalm of David.
Lord, I call to you; hasten to me;
    listen to my plea when I call.

    2: 
Let my prayer be incense before you;
    my uplifted hands an evening offering.

    3: 
    4: 
Prayer for Deliverance from the Wicked
1 A psalm of David.
Lord, I call to you; hasten to me;
    listen to my plea when I call.
2 
Let my prayer be incense[b] before you;
    my uplifted hands an evening offering.
3 
Set a guard, Lord, before my mouth,
    keep watch over the door of my lips.
4 
Do not let my heart incline to evil,
    to perform deeds in wickedness.
On the delicacies of evildoers
    let me not feast.

    5: 
Let a righteous person strike me; it is mercy if he reproves me.
    Do not withhold oil from my head
    while my prayer opposes their evil deeds.

    6: 
May their leaders be cast over the cliff,
    so that they hear that my speeches are pleasing.

    7: 
Like the plowing and breaking up of the earth,
    our bones are strewn at the mouth of Sheol.

    8: 
For my eyes are upon you, O Lord, my Lord;
    in you I take refuge; do not take away my soul.

    9: Guard me from the trap they have set for me,
    from the snares of evildoers.

    10: 
Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
    while only I pass over them safely.


  Chapter 142.

    1: 
    2: a]
A Prayer in Time of Trouble
1 A maskil of David, when he was in the cave.[b] A prayer.
2 
With my own voice I cry to the Lord;
    with my own voice I beseech the Lord.

    3: 
    4: 
A Prayer in Time of Trouble
1 A maskil of David, when he was in the cave.[b] A prayer.
2 
With my own voice I cry to the Lord;
    with my own voice I beseech the Lord.
3 
Before him I pour out my complaint,
    tell of my distress in front of him.
4 
When my spirit is faint within me,
    you know my path.
As I go along this path,
    they have hidden a trap for me.

    5: 
I look to my right hand to see
    that there is no one willing to acknowledge me.
My escape has perished;
    no one cares for me.

    6: 
I cry out to you, Lord,
    I say, You are my refuge,
    my portion in the land of the living.

    7: 
Listen to my cry for help,
    for I am brought very low.
Rescue me from my pursuers,
    for they are too strong for me.

    8: 
Lead my soul from prison,
    that I may give thanks to your name.
Then the righteous shall gather around me
    because you have been good to me.


  Chapter 143.

    1: 3
A Prayer in Distress

Lord, hear my prayer;
    in your faithfulness listen to my pleading;
    answer me in your righteousness.

    2: 
    3: 
    4: 
A Prayer in Distress
1 A psalm of David.
Lord, hear my prayer;
    in your faithfulness listen to my pleading;
    answer me in your righteousness.
2 
Do not enter into judgment with your servant;
    before you no one can be just.
3 
The enemy has pursued my soul;
    he has crushed my life to the ground.
He has made me dwell in darkness
    like those long dead.
4 
My spirit is faint within me;
    my heart despairs.

    5: 
I remember the days of old;
    I ponder all your deeds;
    the works of your hands I recall.

    6: 
I stretch out my hands toward you,
    my soul to you like a parched land.
Selah

    7: 
Hasten to answer me, Lord;
    for my spirit fails me.
Do not hide your face from me,
    lest I become like those descending to the pit.

    8: 
In the morning let me hear of your mercy,
    for in you I trust.
Show me the path I should walk,
    for I entrust my life to you.

    9: Rescue me, Lord, from my foes,
    for I seek refuge in you.

    10: 
Teach me to do your will,
    for you are my God.
May your kind spirit guide me
    on ground that is level.

    11: 
For your nameâ€™s sake, Lord, give me life;
    in your righteousness lead my soul out of distress.

    12: 
In your mercy put an end to my foes;
    all those who are oppressing my soul,
    for I am your servant.

    on a ten-stringed lyre I will play for you.

    10: 
You give victory to kings;
    you delivered David your servant.

Their mouths speak untruth;
    their right hands are raised in lying oaths.

Blessed the people so fortunate;
    blessed the people whose God is the Lord.
