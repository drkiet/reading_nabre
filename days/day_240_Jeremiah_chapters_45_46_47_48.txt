Day 240:

Reading Jeremiah, chapters ['45', '46', '47', '48']:

  Chapter 45.

    1: The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch, son of Neriah, when he wrote on a scroll words from Jeremiah’s own mouth in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah: 
    2: Thus says the Lord, God of Israel, to you, Baruch. 
    3: 
    4: 
    5: A Message to Baruch. 1 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch, son of Neriah, when he wrote on a scroll words from Jeremiah’s own mouth in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah: 2 Thus says the Lord, God of Israel, to you, Baruch. 3 You said, “Woe is me! the Lord has added grief to my pain. I have worn myself out with groaning; rest eludes me.” 4 You must say this to him. Thus says the Lord: What I have built, I am tearing down; what I have planted, I am uprooting: all this land. 5 And you, do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them! I am bringing evil on all flesh—oracle of the Lord—but I will grant you your life as spoils of war, wherever you may go.


  Chapter 46.

    1: The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
Against Egypt. 
    2: Concerning Egypt. Against the army of Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates by Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah:

    3: 
    4: 
1 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
Against Egypt. 2 Concerning Egypt. Against the army of Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates by Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah:
3 
Prepare buckler and shield!
    move forward to battle!
4 
Harness the horses,
    charioteers, mount up!
Fall in, with helmets on;
    polish your spears, put on your armor.

    5: 
    6: 1 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
Against Egypt. 2 Concerning Egypt. Against the army of Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates by Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah:
3 
Prepare buckler and shield!
    move forward to battle!
4 
Harness the horses,
    charioteers, mount up!
Fall in, with helmets on;
    polish your spears, put on your armor.
5 
What do I see?
    Are they panicking, falling apart?
    Their warriors are hammered back,
They flee headlong
    never making a stand.
Terror on every side—
    oracle of the Lord!
6 
The swift cannot flee,
    nor the warrior escape:
There up north, on the banks of the Euphrates
    they stumble and fall.

    7: 
Who is this? Like the Nile, it rears up;
    like rivers, its waters surge.

    8: 
Egypt rears up like the Nile,
    like rivers, its waters surge.
“I will rear up,” it says, “and cover the earth,
    destroying the city and its people.

    9: Forward, horses!
    charge, chariots!
March forth, warriors,
    Cush and Put, bearing shields,
    Archers of Lud, stretching bows!”

    10: 
Today belongs to the Lord God of hosts,
    a day of vengeance, vengeance on his foes!
The sword devours and is sated, drunk with their blood:
    for the Lord God of hosts holds a sacrifice
    in the land of the north, on the River Euphrates.

    11: 
Go up to Gilead, procure balm,
    Virgin daughter Egypt!
No use to multiply remedies;
    for you there is no healing.

    12: 
The nations hear your cries,
    your screaming fills the earth.
Warrior stumbles against warrior,
    both collapse together.

    13: The word that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet when Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, came to attack the land of Egypt:

    14: 
Proclaim in Egypt, announce in Migdol,
    announce in Memphis and Tahpanhes!
Say: Fall in, get ready,
    the sword has devoured your neighbors.

    15: 
Why has Apis fled?
    Your champion did not stand,
Because the Lord thrust him down;

    16: 
    he stumbled repeatedly then collapsed.
They said to each other,
    “Get up! We must return to our own people,
To the land of our birth,
    away from the destroying sword.”

    17: 
Give Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the name
    “Braggart-missed-his-chance.”

    18: 
As I live, says the King
    whose name is Lord of hosts,
Like Tabor above mountains,
    like Carmel above the sea, he comes.

    19: 
Pack your bags for exile,
    enthroned daughter Egypt;
Memphis shall become a wasteland,
    an empty ruin.

    20: 
Egypt is a beautiful heifer,
    a horsefly from the north keeps coming.

    21: 
Even the mercenaries in her ranks
    are like fattened calves;
They too turn and flee together—
    they do not stand their ground,
For their day of ruin comes upon them,
    their time of punishment.

    22: 
Her voice is like a snake!
    Yes, they come in force;
They attack her with axes,
    like those who fell trees.

    23: 
They cut down her forest—oracle of the Lord—
    impenetrable though it be;
More numerous than locusts,
    they cannot be counted.

    24: 
Shamed is daughter Egypt,
    handed over to a people from the north.

    25: The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, has said: See! I will punish Amon of Thebes and Egypt, gods, kings, Pharaoh, and those who trust in him. 
    26: I will hand them over to those who seek their lives, to Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and to his officers. But later, Egypt shall be inhabited again, as in days of old—oracle of the Lord.

    27: 
But you, my servant Jacob, do not fear;
    do not be dismayed, Israel!
Listen! I will deliver you from far-off lands;
    your offspring, from the land of their exile.
Jacob shall again find rest,
    secure, with none to frighten him.

    28: 
You, Jacob my servant, must not fear—oracle of the Lord—
    for I am with you;
I will make an end of all the nations
    to which I have driven you,
But of you I will not make an end:
    I will chastise you as you deserve,
    I cannot let you go unpunished.


  Chapter 47.

    1: The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh attacked Gaza:

    2: 
Thus says the Lord:
 See: waters are rising from the north,
    to become a torrent in flood;
They shall flood the land and all it contains,
    the cities and their inhabitants.
People will howl and wail,
    every inhabitant of the land.

    3: 
    4: 
Against the Philistines. 1 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh attacked Gaza:
2 
Thus says the Lord:
 See: waters are rising from the north,
    to become a torrent in flood;
They shall flood the land and all it contains,
    the cities and their inhabitants.
People will howl and wail,
    every inhabitant of the land.
3 
At the noise of the pounding hooves of his steeds,
    the clanking chariots, the rumbling wheels,
Parents do not turn back for their children;
    their hands hang helpless,
4 
Because of the day that is coming
    to destroy all the Philistines
And cut off from Tyre and Sidon[b]
    the last of their allies.
Yes, the Lord is destroying the Philistines,
    the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor.

    5: 
Baldness is visited upon Gaza,
    Ashkelon is reduced to silence;
Ashdod, remnant of their strength,
    how long will you gash yourself?

    6: 
    7: Against the Philistines. 1 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh attacked Gaza:
2 
Thus says the Lord:
 See: waters are rising from the north,
    to become a torrent in flood;
They shall flood the land and all it contains,
    the cities and their inhabitants.
People will howl and wail,
    every inhabitant of the land.
3 
At the noise of the pounding hooves of his steeds,
    the clanking chariots, the rumbling wheels,
Parents do not turn back for their children;
    their hands hang helpless,
4 
Because of the day that is coming
    to destroy all the Philistines
And cut off from Tyre and Sidon[b]
    the last of their allies.
Yes, the Lord is destroying the Philistines,
    the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor.
5 
Baldness is visited upon Gaza,
    Ashkelon is reduced to silence;
Ashdod, remnant of their strength,
    how long will you gash yourself?[c]
6 
Ah! Sword of the Lord!
    When will you find rest?
Return to your scabbard;
    stop, be still!
7 
How can it find rest
    when the Lord has commanded it?
Against Ashkelon and the seacoast,
    there he has appointed it.


  Chapter 48.

    1: Concerning Moab. Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:
Ah, Nebo! it is ravaged;
    Kiriathaim is disgraced, captured;
Disgraced and overthrown is the stronghold:

    2: 
    Moab’s glory is no more.
In Heshbon they plot evil against her:
    “Come! We will put an end to her as a nation.”
You, too, Madmen, shall be silenced;
    you the sword stalks!

    3: 
    4: 
Against Moab. 1 Concerning Moab. Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:
Ah, Nebo! it is ravaged;
    Kiriathaim is disgraced, captured;
Disgraced and overthrown is the stronghold:
2 
    Moab’s glory is no more.
In Heshbon they plot evil against her:
    “Come! We will put an end to her as a nation.”
You, too, Madmen,[b] shall be silenced;
    you the sword stalks!
3 
Listen! an outcry from Horonaim,
    “Ruin and great destruction!”
4 
“Moab is crushed!”
    their outcry is heard in Zoar.

    5: 
Up the ascent of Luhith
    they go weeping;
At the descent to Horonaim
    they hear cries of anguish:

    6: 
“Flee, save your lives!
    Be like a wild donkey in the wilderness!”

    7: 
    8: Against Moab. 1 Concerning Moab. Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:
Ah, Nebo! it is ravaged;
    Kiriathaim is disgraced, captured;
Disgraced and overthrown is the stronghold:
2 
    Moab’s glory is no more.
In Heshbon they plot evil against her:
    “Come! We will put an end to her as a nation.”
You, too, Madmen,[b] shall be silenced;
    you the sword stalks!
3 
Listen! an outcry from Horonaim,
    “Ruin and great destruction!”
4 
“Moab is crushed!”
    their outcry is heard in Zoar.
5 
Up the ascent of Luhith
    they go weeping;
At the descent to Horonaim
    they hear cries of anguish:
6 
“Flee, save your lives!
    Be like a wild donkey in the wilderness!”
7 
Because you trusted in your works and your treasures,
    you also shall be captured.
Chemosh[c] shall go into exile,
    his priests and princes with him.
8 
The destroyer comes upon every city,
    not a city escapes;
Ruined is the valley,
    wasted the plateau—oracle of the Lord.

    9: Set up a tombstone for Moab;
    it will soon become a complete wasteland,
Its cities turned into ruins
    where no one dwells.

    10: 
Cursed are they who do the Lord’s work carelessly,
    cursed those who keep their sword from shedding blood.

    11: 
Moab has been resting from its youth,
    suspended above its dregs,
Never poured from flask to flask,
    never driven into exile.
Thus it retained its flavor,
    its bouquet is not lost.

    12: Be assured! The days are coming—oracle of the Lord—when I will send him wine-makers to decant the wine; they shall empty its flasks and smash its jars. 
    13: Chemosh shall disappoint Moab, just as the house of Israel was disappointed by Bethel, in which they trusted.

    14: 
How can you say, “We are heroes,
    mighty warriors”?

    15: 
The one who ravages Moab and its cities comes up,
    the best of its youth go down to slaughter—
    oracle of the King, whose name is Lord of hosts.

    16: 
Moab’s ruin is near at hand,
    its disaster approaches swiftly.

    17: 
Mourn, all you neighbors,
    all you who know its name!
Say: How the mighty scepter is broken,
    the glorious staff!

    18: 
Come down from glory, sit on the parched ground,
    enthroned daughter Dibon;
Moab’s destroyer has fallen upon you,
    has shattered your strongholds.

    19: 
Stand along the road, keep watch,
    enthroned Aroer;
Ask the fleeing man, the escaping woman:
    ask them what has happened.

    20: 
“Moab is put to shame, destroyed.”
    Wail and cry out,
Proclaim it at the Arnon:
    “Moab is destroyed!”

    21: Judgment has come upon the plateau: on Holon, Jahzah, and Mephaath, 
    22: on Dibon, Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim, 
    23: on Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon, 
    24: on Kerioth and on Bozrah: on all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near.

    25: 
The horn of Moab is cut off,
    its arm is broken—oracle of the Lord.

    26: Make him drunk because he set himself over against the Lord; let Moab swim in his vomit and become a laughingstock. 
    27: Has Israel not been a laughingstock to you? Was he caught among thieves that you wag your heads whenever you speak of him?

    28: 
Abandon the cities, take shelter in the crags,
    inhabitants of Moab.
Be like the dove that nests
    in the walls of a gorge.

    29: 
We have heard of the pride of Moab,
    pride beyond bounds:
His loftiness, his pride, his scorn,
    his insolent heart.

    30: 
I myself know his arrogance—oracle of the Lord—
    liar in word, liar in deed.

    31: 
And so I wail over Moab,
    over all Moab I cry,
    over the people of Kir-heres I moan.

    32: 
More than for Jazer I weep for you,
    vine of Sibmah.
Your tendrils trailed down to the sea,
    as far as Jazer they stretched.
Upon your summer harvest and your vintage,
    the destroyer has fallen.

    33: 
Joy and gladness are taken away
    from the garden land, the land of Moab.
I dry up the wine from the wine vats,
    the treader treads no more,
    the vintage shout is stilled.

    34: The cry of Heshbon and Elealeh is heard as far as Jahaz; they call from Zoar to Horonaim and to Eglath-shelishiyah; even the waters of Nimrim turn into a wasteland. 
    35: I will leave no one in Moab—oracle of the Lord—to offer burnt offerings on the high place or to make sacrifices to their gods. 
    36: Hence my heart wails like a flute for Moab; my heart wails like a flute for the people of Kir-heres: the wealth they accumulated has perished. 
    37: Every head has been shaved bald, every beard cut off; every hand gashed, and all their loins are draped in sackcloth. 
    38: On all the rooftops of Moab and in all its squares there is mourning. I have shattered Moab like a pot that no one wants—oracle of the Lord. 
    39: How terrified they are, how they wail! How Moab turns its back in shame! Moab has become a laughingstock and a horror to all its neighbors!

    40: 
For thus says the Lord:
Look there! Like an eagle he swoops,
    spreading his wings over Moab.

    41: 
Cities are captured,
    strongholds seized:
On that day the hearts of Moab’s warriors
    become like the heart of a woman in labor.

    42: 
Moab shall be wiped out, a people no more,
    because it set itself over against the Lord.

    43: 
Terror, pit, and trap be upon you,
    enthroned Moab—oracle of the Lord.

    44: 
Those fleeing the terror
    fall into the pit;
Those climbing out of the pit
    are caught in the trap;
Ah, yes! I will bring these things upon Moab
    in the year of their punishment—oracle of the Lord.

    45: 
In Heshbon’s shadow the fugitives
    stop short, exhausted;
For fire blazes up from Heshbon,
    and flames up from the house of Sihon:
It consumes the forehead of Moab,
    the scalp of the noisemakers.

    46: 
Woe to you, Moab!
    You are finished, people of Chemosh!
Your sons are taken into exile,
    your daughters into captivity.

    47: 
    48: Against Moab. 1 Concerning Moab. Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:
Ah, Nebo! it is ravaged;
    Kiriathaim is disgraced, captured;
Disgraced and overthrown is the stronghold:

In Heshbon they plot evil against her:
    “Come! We will put an end to her as a nation.”

    you the sword stalks!
3

    where no one dwells.
10 
Cursed are they who do the Lord’s work carelessly,
    cursed those who keep their sword from shedding blood.
11 
[d]Moab has been resting from its youth,
    suspended above its dregs,
Never poured from flask to flask,
    never driven into exile.
Thus it retained its flavor,
    its bouquet is not lost.
12 Be assured! The days are coming—oracle of the Lord—when I will send him wine-makers to decant the wine; they shall empty its flasks and smash its jars. 13 Chemosh shall disappoint Moab, just as the house of Israel was disappointed by Bethel, in which they trusted.

47 
Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab
    in the days to come—oracle of the Lord.
Thus far the judgment on Moab.


End of day 240.
