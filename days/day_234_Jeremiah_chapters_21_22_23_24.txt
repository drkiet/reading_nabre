Day 234:

Reading Jeremiah, chapters ['21', '22', '23', '24']:

  Chapter 21.

    1: 
    2: 
Fate of Zedekiah and Jerusalem. 1 The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur, son of Malchiah, and the priest Zephaniah, son of Maaseiah, to him with this request: 2 Inquire for us of the Lord, because Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, is attacking us. Perhaps the Lord will act for us in accord with his wonderful works by making him withdraw from us. 
    3: But Jeremiah answered them: This is what you shall report to Zedekiah: 
    4: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I will turn against you the weapons with which you are fighting the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who besiege you outside the walls. These weapons I will pile up in the midst of this city, 
    5: and I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and mighty arm, in anger, wrath, and great rage! 
    6: I will strike down the inhabitants of this city, human being and beast; they shall die in a great pestilence. 
    7: After that—oracle of the Lord—I will hand over Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his ministers and the people in this city who survive pestilence, sword, and famine, to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to their enemies and those who seek their lives. He shall strike them down with the edge of the sword, without quarter, without mercy or compassion. 
    8: And to this people you shall say: Thus says the Lord: See, I am giving you a choice between the way to life and the way to death. 
    9: hoever remains in this city shall die by the sword or famine or pestilence. But whoever leaves and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall live and escape with his life. 
    10: I have set my face against this city, for evil and not for good—oracle of the Lord. It shall be given into the power of the king of Babylon who shall set it on fire.
Oracles Regarding the Kings[c]

    11: 
To the royal house of Judah:
Hear the word of the Lord,

    12: 
    house of David!
    Thus says the Lord:
Each morning dispense justice,
    rescue the oppressed from the hand of the oppressor,
Or my fury will break out like fire
    and burn with no one to quench it
    because of your evil deeds.

    13: 
Beware! I am against you, Ruler of the Valley,
    Rock of the Plain—oracle of the Lord.
You say, “Who will attack us,
    who can storm our defenses?”

    14: 
I will punish you—oracle of the Lord—
    as your deeds deserve!
I will kindle a fire in its forest
    that shall devour all its surroundings.


  Chapter 22.

    1: 
    2: 
1 Thus says the Lord: Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and there deliver this word: 2 You shall say: Listen to the word of the Lord, king of Judah, who sit on the throne of David, you, your ministers, and your people who enter by these gates! 
    3: Thus says the Lord: Do what is right and just. Rescue the victims from the hand of their oppressors. Do not wrong or oppress the resident alien, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place. 
    4: If you carry out these commands, kings who succeed to the throne of David will continue to enter the gates of this house, riding in chariots or mounted on horses, with their ministers, and their people. 
    5: But if you do not obey these commands, I swear by myself—oracle of the Lord: this house shall become rubble. 
    6: For thus says the Lord concerning the house of the king of Judah:
Though you be to me like Gilead,
    like the peak of Lebanon,
I swear I shall turn you into a waste,
    with cities uninhabited.

    7: 
Against you I will send destroyers,
    each with their tools:
They shall cut down your choice cedars,
    and cast them into the fire.

    8: Many nations will pass by this city and ask one another: “Why has the Lord done this to so great a city?” 
    9: nd they will be told: “Because they have deserted their covenant with the Lord, their God, by worshiping and serving other gods.”
Jehoahaz

    10: 
Do not weep for him who is dead,
    nor mourn for him!
Weep rather for him who is going away;
    never again to see
    the land of his birth.

    11: Thus says the Lord concerning Shallum, son of Josiah, king of Judah, his father’s successor, who left this place: He shall never return, 
    12: but in the place where they exiled him, there he shall die; he shall never see this land again.
Jehoiakim

    13: 
Woe to him who builds his house on wrongdoing,
    his roof-chambers on injustice;
Who works his neighbors without pay,
    and gives them no wages.

    14: 
Who says, “I will build myself a spacious house,
    with airy rooms,”
Who cuts out windows for it,
    panels it with cedar,
    and paints it with vermilion.

    15: 
Must you prove your rank among kings
    by competing with them in cedar?
Did not your father eat and drink,
    And act justly and righteously?
    Then he prospered.

    16: 
Because he dispensed justice to the weak and the poor,
    he prospered.
Is this not to know me?—
    oracle of the Lord.

    17: 
But your eyes and heart are set on nothing
    except your own gain,
On shedding innocent blood
    and practicing oppression and extortion.

    18: Therefore, thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah:
They shall not lament him,
    “Alas! my brother”; “Alas! sister.”
They shall not lament him,
    “Alas, Lord! alas, Majesty!”

    19: 
The burial of a donkey he shall be given,
    dragged forth and cast out
    beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
Jeconiah

    20: 
Climb Lebanon and cry out,
    in Bashan lift up your voice;
Cry out from Abarim,
    for all your lovers are crushed.

    21: 
    22: 1 Thus says the Lord: Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and there deliver this word: 2 You shall say: Listen to the word of the Lord, king of Judah, who sit on the throne of David, you, your ministers, and your people who enter by these gates! 3 Thus says the Lord: Do what is right and just. Rescue the victims from the hand of their oppressors. Do not wrong or oppress the resident alien, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place. 4 If you carry out these commands, kings who succeed to the throne of David will continue to enter the gates of this house, riding in chariots or mounted on horses, with their ministers, and their people. 5 But if you do not obey these commands, I swear by myself—oracle of the Lord: this house shall become rubble. 6 For thus says the Lord concerning the house of the king of Judah:
Though you be to me like Gilead,
    like the peak of Lebanon,
I swear I shall turn you into a waste,
    with cities uninhabited.
7 
Against you I will send destroyers,
    each with their tools:
They shall cut down your choice cedars,
    and cast them into the fire.
8 Many nations will pass by this city and ask one another: “Why has the Lord done this to so great a city?” 9 And they will be told: “Because they have deserted their covenant with the Lord, their God, by worshiping and serving other gods.”
Jehoahaz
10 
Do not weep for him who is dead,
    nor mourn for him!
Weep rather for him who is going away;
    never again to see
    the land of his birth.
11 Thus says the Lord concerning Shallum,[b] son of Josiah, king of Judah, his father’s successor, who left this place: He shall never return, 12 but in the place where they exiled him, there he shall die; he shall never see this land again.
Jehoiakim
13 
Woe to him who builds his house on wrongdoing,
    his roof-chambers on injustice;
Who works his neighbors without pay,[c]
    and gives them no wages.
14 
Who says, “I will build myself a spacious house,
    with airy rooms,”
Who cuts out windows for it,
    panels it with cedar,
    and paints it with vermilion.
15 
Must you prove your rank among kings[d]
    by competing with them in cedar?
Did not your father eat and drink,
    And act justly and righteously?
    Then he prospered.
16 
Because he dispensed justice to the weak and the poor,
    he prospered.
Is this not to know me?—
    oracle of the Lord.
17 
But your eyes and heart are set on nothing
    except your own gain,
On shedding innocent blood
    and practicing oppression and extortion.
18 Therefore, thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah:
They shall not lament him,
    “Alas! my brother”; “Alas! sister.”[e]
They shall not lament him,
    “Alas, Lord! alas, Majesty!”
19 
The burial of a donkey[f] he shall be given,
    dragged forth and cast out
    beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
Jeconiah
20 
Climb Lebanon and cry out,[g]
    in Bashan lift up your voice;
Cry out from Abarim,
    for all your lovers are crushed.
21 
I spoke to you when you were secure,
    but you answered, “I will not listen.”
This has been your way from your youth,
    not to listen to my voice.
22 
The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds,
    your lovers shall go into exile.
Surely then you shall be ashamed and confounded
    because of all your wickedness.

    23: 
You who dwell on Lebanon,
    who nest in the cedars,
How you shall groan when pains come upon you,
    like the pangs of a woman in childbirth!

    24: As I live—oracle of the Lord—even if you, Coniah, son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I would snatch you off. 
    25: I will hand you over to those who seek your life, to those you dread: Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and the Chaldeans. 
    26: I will cast you out, you and the mother who bore you, into a land different from the land of your birth; and there you will die; 
    27: Neither shall return to the land for which they yearn.

    28: 
Is this man Coniah a thing despised, to be broken,
    a vessel that no one wants?
Why are he and his offspring cast out?
    why thrown into a land they do not know?

    29: 
O land, land, land,
    hear the word of the Lord—

    30: 
    Thus says the Lord:
Write this man down as childless,
    a man who will never prosper in his life!
Nor shall any of his descendants prosper,
    to sit upon the throne of David,
    to rule again over Judah.


  Chapter 23.

    1: 
    2: 
    3: A Just Shepherd. 1 Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the flock of my pasture—oracle of the Lord. 2 Therefore, thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, against the shepherds who shepherd my people: You have scattered my sheep and driven them away. You have not cared for them, but I will take care to punish your evil deeds. 3 I myself will gather the remnant of my flock from all the lands to which I have banished them and bring them back to their folds; there they shall be fruitful and multiply. 
    4: I will raise up shepherds for them who will shepherd them so that they need no longer fear or be terrified; none shall be missing—oracle of the Lord.

    5: 
See, days are coming—oracle of the Lord—
    when I will raise up a righteous branch for David;
As king he shall reign and govern wisely,
    he shall do what is just and right in the land.

    6: 
In his days Judah shall be saved,
    Israel shall dwell in security.
This is the name to be given him:
    “The Lord our justice.”

    7: Therefore, the days are coming—oracle of the Lord—when they shall no longer say, “As the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt”; 
    8: but rather, “As the Lord lives, who brought the descendants of the house of Israel up from the land of the north”—and from all the lands to which I banished them; they shall again live on their own soil.
The False Prophets

    9: Concerning the prophets:
My heart is broken within me,
    all my bones tremble;
I am like a drunk,
    like one overcome by wine,
Because of the Lord,
    because of his holy words.

    10: 
The land is filled with adulterers;
    because of the curse the land mourns,
    the pastures of the wilderness are withered.
Theirs is an evil course,
    theirs is unjust power.

    11: 
Both prophet and priest are godless!
    In my very house I find their wickedness—
    oracle of the Lord.

    12: 
Hence their way shall become for them
    slippery ground.
Into the darkness they shall be driven,
    and fall headlong;
For I will bring disaster upon them,
    the year of their punishment—oracle of the Lord.

    13: 
Among Samaria’s prophets
    I saw something unseemly:
They prophesied by Baal
    and led my people Israel astray.

    14: 
But among Jerusalem’s prophets
    I saw something more shocking:
Adultery, walking in deception,
    strengthening the power of the wicked,
    so that no one turns from evil;
To me they are all like Sodom,
    its inhabitants like Gomorrah.

    15: Therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts against the prophets:
Look, I will give them wormwood to eat,
    and poisoned water to drink;
For from Jerusalem’s prophets
    ungodliness has gone forth into the whole land.

    16: 
    Thus says the Lord of hosts:
Do not listen to the words of your prophets,
    who fill you with emptiness;
They speak visions from their own fancy,
    not from the mouth of the Lord.

    17: 
They say to those who despise the word of the Lord,
    “Peace shall be yours”;
And to everyone who walks in hardness of heart,
    “No evil shall overtake you.”

    18: 
Now, who has stood in the council of the Lord,
    to see him and to hear his word?
    Who has heeded his word so as to announce it?

    19: 
See, the storm of the Lord!
    His wrath breaks forth
In a whirling storm
    that bursts upon the heads of the wicked.

    20: 
The anger of the Lord shall not abate
    until he has carried out completely
    the decisions of his heart.
In days to come
    you will understand fully.

    21: 
I did not send these prophets,
    yet they ran;
I did not speak to them,
    yet they prophesied.

    22: 
    23: A Just Shepherd. 1 Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the flock of my pasture—oracle of the Lord. 2 Therefore, thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, against the shepherds who shepherd my people: You have scattered my sheep and driven them away. You have not cared for them, but I will take care to punish your evil deeds. 3 I myself will gather the remnant of my flock from all the lands to which I have banished them and bring them back to their folds; there they shall be fruitful and multiply. 4 I will raise up shepherds for them who will shepherd them so that they need no longer fear or be terrified; none shall be missing—oracle of the Lord.
5 
See, days are coming—oracle of the Lord—
    when I will raise up a righteous branch for David;
As king he shall reign and govern wisely,
    he shall do what is just and right in the land.
6 
In his days Judah shall be saved,
    Israel shall dwell in security.
This is the name to be given him:
    “The Lord our justice.”
7 Therefore, the days are coming—oracle of the Lord—when they shall no longer say, “As the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt”; 8 but rather, “As the Lord lives, who brought the descendants of the house of Israel up from the land of the north”—and from all the lands to which I banished them; they shall again live on their own soil.
The False Prophets[b]
9 
Concerning the prophets:
My heart is broken within me,
    all my bones tremble;

    like one overcome by wine,

    because of his holy words.
10

    because of the curse the land mourns,
    the pastures of the wilderness are withered.
Theirs is an evil course,
    theirs is unjust power.
11

For from Jerusalem’s prophets
    ungodliness has gone forth into the whole land.
16 
    Thus says the Lord of hosts:
Do not listen to the words of your prophets,
    who fill you with emptiness;

    not from the mouth of the Lord.
17

    “Peace shall be yours”;
And to everyone who walks in hardness of heart,
    “No evil shall overtake you.”
18 
Now, who has stood in the council of the Lord,
    to see him and to hear his word?
    Who has heeded his word so as to announce it?
19 
See, the storm of the Lord!
    His wrath breaks forth
In a whirling storm
    that bursts upon the heads of the wicked.
20 
The anger of the Lord shall not abate
    until he has carried out completely
    the decisions of his heart.
In days to come
    you will understand fully.
21 
I did not send these prophets,
    yet they ran;
I did not speak to them,
    yet they prophesied.
22 
Had they stood in my council,
    they would have proclaimed my words to my people,
They would have brought them back from their evil ways
    and from their wicked deeds.
23 
Am I a God near at hand only—oracle of the Lord—
    and not a God far off?[e]

    24: 
Can anyone hide in secret
    without my seeing them?—oracle of the Lord.
Do I not fill
    heaven and earth?—oracle of the Lord.

    25: I have heard the prophets who prophesy lies in my name say, “I had a dream! I had a dream!” 
    26: How long? Will the hearts of the prophets who prophesy lies and their own deceitful fancies ever turn back? 
    27: By the dreams they tell each other, they plan to make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name for Baal. 
    28: Let the prophets who have dreams tell their dreams; let those who have my word speak my word truthfully!
What has straw to do with wheat?
    —oracle of the Lord.

    29: 
Is not my word like fire—oracle of the Lord—
    like a hammer shattering rock?

    30: Therefore I am against the prophets—oracle of the Lord—those who steal my words from each other. 
    31: Yes, I am against the prophets—oracle of the Lord—those who compose their own speeches and call them oracles. 
    32: Yes, I am against the prophets who tell lying dreams—oracle of the Lord—those who lead my people astray by recounting their reckless lies. It was not I who sent them or commanded them; they do this people no good at all—oracle of the Lord.

    33: And when this people or a prophet or a priest asks you, “What is the burden of the Lord?” you shall answer, “You are the burden, and I cast you off”—oracle of the Lord. 
    34: If a prophet or a priest or anyone else mentions “the burden of the Lord,” I will punish that man and his household. 
    35: Thus you shall ask, when speaking to one another, “What answer did the Lord give?” or “What did the Lord say?” 
    36: But “the burden of the Lord” you shall mention no more. For each of you, your own word becomes the burden so that you pervert the words of the living God, the Lord of hosts, our God. 
    37: Thus shall you ask the prophet, “What answer did the Lord give?” or “What did the Lord say?” 
    38: But if you ask about “the burden of the Lord,” then thus says the Lord: Because you use this phrase, “the burden of the Lord,” though I forbade you to use it, 
    39: therefore I will lift you on high and cast you from my presence, you and the city which I gave to you and your ancestors. 
    40: And I will bring upon you eternal reproach, eternal shame, never to be forgotten.


  Chapter 24.

    1: 
    2: 
The Two Baskets of Figs. 1 The Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the Lord. This was after Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had exiled from Jerusalem Jeconiah,[b] son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, the artisans and smiths, and brought them to Babylon. 2 One basket contained excellent figs, those that ripen early. But the other basket contained very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten. 
    3: 
    4: The Two Baskets of Figs. 1 The Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the Lord. This was after Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had exiled from Jerusalem Jeconiah,[b] son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, the artisans and smiths, and brought them to Babylon. 2 One basket contained excellent figs, those that ripen early. But the other basket contained very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten. 3 Then the Lord said to me: What do you see, Jeremiah? “Figs,” I replied; “the good ones are very good, but the bad ones very bad, so bad they cannot be eaten.” 4 Thereupon this word of the Lord came to me: 
    5: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, I will also regard with favor Judah’s exiles whom I sent away from this place into the land of the Chaldeans. 
    6: I will look after them for good and bring them back to this land, to build them up, not tear them down; to plant them, not uproot them. 
    7: I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord. They shall be my people and I will be their God, for they shall return to me with their whole heart. 
    8: But like the figs that are bad, so bad they cannot be eaten—yes, thus says the Lord—even so will I treat Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his princes, the remnant of Jerusalem remaining in this land and those who have settled in the land of Egypt. 
    9:  will make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a reproach and a byword, a taunt and a curse, in all the places to which I will drive them. 
    10: I will send upon them sword, famine, and pestilence, until they have disappeared from the land which I gave them and their ancestors.
