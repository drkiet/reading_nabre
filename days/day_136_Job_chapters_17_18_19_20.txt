Day 136:

Reading Job, chapters ['17', '18', '19', '20']:

  Chapter 17.

    1: 
1 
My spirit is broken, my days finished,
    my burial at hand.

    2: 
Surely mockers surround me,
    at their provocation, my eyes grow dim.

    3: 
Put up a pledge for me with you:
    who is there to give surety for me?

    4: 
You darken their minds to knowledge;
    therefore you will not exalt them.

    5: 
For a share of property he informs on friends,
    while the eyes of his children grow dim.

    6: 
    7: 1 
My spirit is broken, my days finished,
    my burial at hand.
2 
Surely mockers surround me,
    at their provocation, my eyes grow dim.
3 
Put up a pledge for me with you:
    who is there to give surety for me?
4 
You darken their minds to knowledge;
    therefore you will not exalt them.
5 
For a share of property he informs on friends,
    while the eyes of his children grow dim.
6 
I am made a byword of the people;
    I am one at whom people spit.
7 
My eyes are blind with anguish,
    and my whole frame is like a shadow.

    8: 
The upright are astonished at this,
    the innocent aroused against the wicked.

    9: The righteous holds to his way,
    the one with clean hands increases in strength.

    10: 
But turn now, and come on again;
    I do not find a wise man among you!

    11: 
My days pass by, my plans are at an end,
    the yearning of my heart.

    12: 
They would change the night into day;
    where there is darkness they talk of approaching light.

    13: 
If my only hope is dwelling in Sheol,
    and spreading my couch in darkness,

    14: 
If I am to say to the pit, “You are my father,”
    and to the worm “my mother,” “my sister,”

    15: 
Where then is my hope,
    my happiness, who can see it?

    16: 
    17: 1 
My spirit is broken, my days finished,
    my burial at hand.
2 
Surely mockers surround me,
    at their provocation, my eyes grow dim.
3 
Put up a pledge for me with you:
    who is there to give surety for me?
4 
You darken their minds to knowledge;
    therefore you will not exalt them.
5 
For a share of property he informs on friends,
    while the eyes of his children grow dim.
6 
I am made a byword of the people;
    I am one at whom people spit.
7 
My eyes are blind with anguish,
    and my whole frame is like a shadow.
8 
The upright are astonished at this,
    the innocent aroused against the wicked.
9 
The righteous holds to his way,
    the one with clean hands increases in strength.
10 
But turn now, and come on again;
    I do not find a wise man among you!
11 
My days pass by, my plans are at an end,
    the yearning of my heart.
12 
They would change the night into day;
    where there is darkness they talk of approaching light.
13 
[b]If my only hope is dwelling in Sheol,
    and spreading my couch in darkness,
14 
If I am to say to the pit, “You are my father,”
    and to the worm “my mother,” “my sister,”
15 
Where then is my hope,
    my happiness, who can see it?
16 
Will they descend with me into Sheol?
    Shall we go down together into the dust?


  Chapter 18.

    1: 
Bildad’s Second Speech. 1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:

    2: 
When will you put an end to words?
    Reflect, and then we can have discussion.

    3: 
Why are we accounted like beasts,
    equal to them in your sight?

    4: 
You who tear yourself in your anger—
    shall the earth be neglected on your account
    or the rock be moved out of its place?

    5: 
Truly, the light of the wicked is extinguished;
    the flame of his fire casts no light.

    6: 
In his tent light is darkness;
    the lamp above him goes out.

    7: 
    8: Bildad’s Second Speech. 1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:

5 
Truly, the light of the wicked is extinguished;
    the flame of his fire casts no light.
6 
In his tent light is darkness;
    the lamp above him goes out.
7 
His vigorous steps are hemmed in,
    his own counsel casts him down.
8 
A net catches him by the feet,
    he wanders into a pitfall.

    9: A trap seizes him by the heel,
    a snare lays hold of him.

    10: 
A noose is hidden for him on the ground,
    a netting for him on the path.

    11: 
On every side terrors frighten him;
    they harry him at each step.

    12: 
His strength is famished,
    disaster is ready at his side,

    13: 
His skin is eaten to the limbs,
    the firstborn of Death eats his limbs.

    14: 
He is plucked from the security of his tent;
    and marched off to the king of terrors.

    15: 
Fire lodges in his tent,
    over his abode brimstone is scattered.

    16: 
Below, his roots dry up,
    and above, his branches wither.

    17: 
    18: Bildad’s Second Speech. 1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:

14 
He is plucked from the security of his tent;
    and marched off to the king of terrors.[b]
15 
Fire lodges in his tent,
    over his abode brimstone is scattered.
16 
Below, his roots dry up,
    and above, his branches wither.
17 
His memory perishes from the earth,
    and he has no name in the countryside.
18 
He is driven from light into darkness,
    and banished from the world.

    19: 
He has neither offshoot nor offspring among his people,
    no survivor where once he dwelt.

    20: 
Those who come after shall be appalled at his fate;
    those who went before are seized with horror.

    21: 
So is it then with the dwelling of the impious;
    such is the place of the one who does not know God!


  Chapter 19.

    1: 
Job’s Fifth Reply. 1 Then Job answered and said:

    2: 
How long will you afflict my spirit,
    grind me down with words?

    3: 
These ten times you have humiliated me,
    have assailed me without shame!

    4: 
Even if it were true that I am at fault,
    my fault would remain with me;

    5: 
If truly you exalt yourselves at my expense,
    and use my shame as an argument against me,

    6: 
Know then that it is God who has dealt unfairly with me,
    and compassed me round with his net.

    7: 
If I cry out “Violence!” I am not answered.
    I shout for help, but there is no justice.

    8: 
    9: ob’s Fifth Reply. 1 Then Job answered and said:
2

3

4

6 
Know then that it is God who has dealt unfairly with me,
    and compassed me round with his net.
7 
If I cry out “Violence!” I am not answered.
    I shout for help, but there is no justice.
8 
He has barred my way and I cannot pass;
    veiled my path in darkness;
9 
He has stripped me of my glory,
    taken the diadem from my brow.

    10: 
He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone;
    he has uprooted my hope like a tree.

    11: 
He has kindled his wrath against me;
    he counts me one of his enemies.

    12: 
His troops advance as one;
    they build up their road to attack me,
    encamp around my tent.

    13: 
My family has withdrawn from me,
    my friends are wholly estranged.

    14: 
My relatives and companions neglect me,
    my guests have forgotten me.

    15: 
Even my maidservants consider me a stranger;
    I am a foreigner in their sight.

    16: 
I call my servant, but he gives no answer,
    though I plead aloud with him.

    17: 
My breath is abhorrent to my wife;
    I am loathsome to my very children.

17 
My breath is abhorrent to my wife;
    I am loathsome to my very children.
18 
Even young children despise me;
    when I appear, they speak against me.
19 
All my intimate friends hold me in horror;
    those whom I loved have turned against me!

    20: 
My bones cling to my skin,
    and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.

    21: 
Pity me, pity me, you my friends,
    for the hand of God has struck me!

    22: 
Why do you pursue me like God,
    and prey insatiably upon me?

    23: 
Oh, would that my words were written down!
    Would that they were inscribed in a record:

    24: 
That with an iron chisel and with lead
    they were cut in the rock forever!

    25: 
As for me, I know that my vindicator lives,
    and that he will at last stand forth upon the dust.

    26: 
This will happen when my skin has been stripped off,
    and from my flesh I will see God:

    27: 
I will see for myself,
    my own eyes, not another’s, will behold him:
    my inmost being is consumed with longing.

    28: 
But you who say, “How shall we persecute him,
    seeing that the root of the matter is found in him?”

    29: 
Be afraid of the sword for yourselves,
    for your anger is a crime deserving the sword;
    that you may know that there is a judgment.


  Chapter 20.

    1: 
    2: 
Zophar’s Second Speech. 1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
2 
So now my thoughts provide an answer for me,
    because of the feelings within me.

    3: 
A rebuke that puts me to shame I hear,
    and from my understanding a spirit gives me a reply.

    4: 
Do you not know this: from of old,
    since human beings were placed upon the earth,

    5: 
The triumph of the wicked is short
    and the joy of the impious but for a moment?

    6: 
Though his pride mount up to the heavens
    and his head reach to the clouds,

    7: 
Yet he perishes forever like the dung he uses for fuel,
    and onlookers say, “Where is he?”

    8: 
Like a dream he takes flight and cannot be found;
    he fades away like a vision of the night.

    9: The eye which saw him does so no more;
    nor shall his dwelling again behold him.

    10: 
His sons will restore to the poor,
    and his hands will yield up his riches.

    11: 
Though his bones are full of youthful vigor,
    it shall lie with him in the dust.

    12: 
Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth,
    and he hides it under his tongue,

    13: 
Though he retains it and will not let it go
    but keeps it still within his mouth,

    14: 
Yet in his stomach the food shall turn;
    it shall be venom of asps inside him.

    15: 
The riches he swallowed he shall vomit up;
    God shall make his belly disgorge them.

    16: 
The poison of asps he shall drink in;
    the viper’s fangs shall slay him.

    17: 
He shall see no streams of oil,
    no torrents of honey or milk.

    18: 
He shall give back his gains, never used;
    like his profit from trade, never enjoyed.

    19: 
    20: Zophar’s Second Speech. 1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:

10

11

12

13

    but keeps it still within his mouth,
14

15

    God shall make his belly disgorge them.
16 
The poison of asps he shall drink in;
    the viper’s fangs shall slay him.
17 
He shall see no streams of oil,
    no torrents of honey or milk.
18 
He shall give back his gains, never used;
    like his profit from trade, never enjoyed.
19 
Because he has oppressed and neglected the poor,
    and stolen a house he did not build;
20 
For he has known no quiet in his greed,
    in his treasure he cannot save himself.

    21: 
None of his survivors will consume it,
    therefore his prosperity shall not endure.

    22: 
When he has more than enough, distress shall be his,
    every sort of trouble shall come upon him.

    23: 
When he has filled his belly,
    God shall send against him the fury of his wrath
    and rain down his missiles upon him.

    24: 
Should he escape an iron weapon,
    a bronze bow shall pierce him through;

    25: 
The dart shall come out of his back,
    a shining point out of his gall-bladder:
    terrors fall upon him.

    26: 
Complete darkness is in store for his treasured ones;
    a fire unfanned shall consume him;
    any survivor in his tent shall be destroyed.

    27: 
The heavens shall reveal his guilt,
    and the earth rise up against him.

    28: 
The flood shall sweep away his house,
    torrents in the day of God’s anger.

    29: 
This is the portion of the wicked,
    the heritage appointed him by God.
