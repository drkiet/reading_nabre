Day 203:

Reading Ben-Sira, chapters ['17', '18', '19', '20']:

  Chapter 17.

    1: 
Creation of Human Beings
1 
The Lord created human beings from the earth,
    and makes them return to earth again.

    2: 
A limited number of days he gave them,
    but granted them authority over everything on earth.

    3: 
He endowed them with strength like his own,
    and made them in his image.

    4: 
He put fear of them in all flesh,
    and gave them dominion over beasts and birds.
6 
Discernment, tongues, and eyes,
    ears, and a mind for thinking he gave them.
7 
With knowledge and understanding he filled them;
    good and evil he showed them.
8 
He put fear of him into their hearts
    to show them the grandeur of his works,
9 
That they might describe the wonders of his deeds
10 
    and praise his holy name.
11 
He set before them knowledge,
    and allotted to them the law of life.
12 
An everlasting covenant he made with them,
    and his commandments[b] he revealed to them.
13 
His majestic glory their eyes beheld,
    his glorious voice their ears heard.
14 
He said to them, “Avoid all evil”;
    to each of them he gave precepts about their neighbor.

His majestic glory their eyes beheld,
    his glorious voice their ears heard.

    14: 
He said to them, “Avoid all evil”;
    to each of them he gave precepts about their neighbor.

    15: 
Their ways are ever known to him,
    they cannot be hidden from his eyes.
17 
Over every nation he appointed a ruler,[d]
    but Israel is the Lord’s own portion.[e]
19 
All their works are clear as the sun to him,
    and his eyes are ever upon their ways.
20 
Their iniquities cannot be hidden from him;
    all their sins are before the Lord.[f]
22 
Human goodness is like a signet ring with God,
    and virtue he keeps like the apple of his eye.
23 
Later he will rise up and repay them,
    requiting each one as they deserve.
Appeal for a Return to God[g]
24 
But to the penitent he provides a way back
    and encourages those who are losing hope!
25 
Turn back to the Lord and give up your sins,
    pray before him and make your offenses few.
26 
Turn again to the Most High and away from iniquity,
    and hate intensely what he loathes.
27 
[h]Who in Sheol can glorify the Most High
    in place of the living who offer their praise?
28 
The dead can no more give praise than those who have never lived;
    they who are alive and well glorify the Lord.
29 
How great is the mercy of the Lord,
    and his forgiveness for those who return to him!
30 
For not everything is within human reach,
    since human beings are not immortal.
31 
Is anything brighter than the sun? Yet it can be eclipsed.
    How worthless[i] then the thoughts of flesh and blood!
32 
God holds accountable the hosts of highest heaven,
    while all mortals are dust and ashes.


  Chapter 18.

    1: 
The Divine Power and Mercy
1 
He who lives forever created the whole universe;

    2: 
    the Lord alone is just.
4 
To whom has he given power to describe his works,
    and who can search out his mighty deeds?
5 
Who can measure his majestic power,
    or fully recount his mercies?
6 
No one can lessen, increase,
    or fathom the wonders of the Lord.
7 
When mortals finish, they are only beginning,
    and when they stop they are still bewildered.
8 
What are mortals? What are they worth?
    What is good in them, and what is evil?
9 
The number of their days seems great
    if it reaches a hundred years.
10 
Like a drop of water from the sea and a grain of sand,
    so are these few years among the days of eternity.
11 
That is why the Lord is patient with them
    and pours out his mercy on them.
12 
He sees and understands that their death is wretched,
    and so he forgives them all the more.

    12: 
He sees and understands that their death is wretched,
    and so he forgives them all the more.

    13: 
Their compassion is for their neighbor,
    but the Lord’s compassion reaches all flesh,
Reproving, admonishing, teaching,
    and turning them back, as a shepherd his flock.

    14: 
He has compassion on those who accept his discipline,
    who are eager for his precepts.
The Need for Prudence

    15: 
My child, add no reproach to your charity,
    or spoil any gift by harsh words.

    16: 
Does not the dew give relief from the scorching heat?
    So a word can be better than a gift.

15 
My child, add no reproach to your charity,[c]
    or spoil any gift by harsh words.
16 
Does not the dew give relief from the scorching heat?
    So a word can be better than a gift.
17 
Indeed does not a word count more than a good gift?
    But both are offered by a kind person.
18 
The fool is ungracious and abusive,
    and a grudging gift makes the eyes smart.

    19: 
Before you speak, learn;
    before you get sick, prepare the cure.

    20: 
Before you are judged, examine yourself,
    and at the time of scrutiny you will have forgiveness.

    21: 
Before you fall ill, humble yourself;
    and when you have sinned, show repentance.
Do not delay forsaking your sins;
    do not neglect to do so until you are in distress.

    22: 
Let nothing prevent the prompt payment of your vows;
    do not wait until death to fulfill them.

    23: 
Before making a vow prepare yourself;
    do not be like one who puts the Lord to the test.

    24: 
Think of wrath on the day of death,
    the time of vengeance when he will hide his face.

    25: 
Think of the time of hunger in the time of plenty,
    poverty and need in the day of wealth.

    26: 
Between morning and evening there is a change of time;
    before the Lord all things are fleeting.

    27: 
The wise are discreet in all things;
    where sin is rife they keep themselves from wrongdoing.

    28: 
Every wise person teaches wisdom,
    and those who know her declare her praise;

    29: 
Those skilled in words become wise themselves,
    and pour forth apt proverbs.
Self-Control

    30: 
Do not let your passions be your guide,
    but keep your desires in check.

    31: 
If you allow yourself to satisfy your passions,
    they will make you the laughingstock of your enemies.

    32: 
Take no pleasure in too much luxury
    which brings on poverty redoubled.

    33: 
Do not become a glutton and a drunkard
    with nothing in your purse.


  Chapter 19.

    1: 
1 
Whoever does this grows no richer;
    those who waste the little they have will be stripped bare.

    2: 
Wine and women make the heart lustful,
    and the companion of prostitutes becomes reckless.

    3: 
Rottenness and worms will possess him,
    and the reckless will be snatched away.

    4: 
Whoever trusts others too quickly has a shallow mind,
    and those who sin wrong themselves.
The Proper Use of Speech

    5: 
Whoever gloats over evil will be destroyed,

    6: 
    and whoever repeats gossip has no sense.

    7: 
Never repeat gossip,
    and no one will reproach you.

    8: 
    9:  
Whoever does this grows no richer;
    those who waste the little they have will be stripped bare.

5 
Whoever gloats over evil will be destroyed,
6 
    and whoever repeats gossip has no sense.
7 
Never repeat gossip,
    and no one will reproach you.
8 
Tell nothing to friend or foe;
    and unless it be a sin for you, do not reveal a thing.
9 
For someone may have heard you and watched you,
    and in time come to hate you.

    10: 
Let anything you hear die with you;
    never fear, it will not make you burst!

    11: 
Having heard something, the fool goes into labor,
    like a woman giving birth to a child.

    12: 
Like an arrow stuck in a fool’s thigh,
    so is gossip in the belly of a fool.

    13: 
Admonish your friend—he may not have done it;
    and if he did, that he may not do it again.

    14: 
Admonish your neighbor—he may not have said it;
    and if he did, that he may not say it again.

    15: 
Admonish your friend—often it may be slander;
    do not believe every story.

    16: 
Then, too, a person can slip and not mean it;
    who has not sinned with his tongue?

    17: 
Admonish your neighbor before you break with him;
    and give due place to the Law of the Most High.
How to Recognize True Wisdom[c]
20 
All wisdom is fear of the Lord;
    and in all wisdom, the observance of the Law.[d]
22 
The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom,
    nor is there prudence in the counsel of sinners.
23 
There is a shrewdness that is detestable,
    while the fool may be free from sin.
24 
Better are the God-fearing who have little understanding
    than those of great intelligence who violate the Law.
25 
There is a shrewdness keen but dishonest,
    and there are those who are duplicitous to win a judgment.
26 
There is the villain bowed in grief,
    but full of deceit within.
27 
He hides his face and pretends not to hear,
    but when not observed, he will take advantage of you:
28 
Even if his lack of strength keeps him from sinning,
    when he finds the right time he will do harm.
29 
People are known by their appearance;
    the sensible are recognized as such when first met.
30 
One’s attire, hearty laughter, and gait
    proclaim him for what he is.


  Chapter 20.

    1: 
    2: 
Conduct of the Wise and the Foolish
1 
There is an admonition that is untimely,
    but the silent person is the wise one.
2 
It is much better to admonish than to lose one’s temper;

    3: 
    one who admits a fault will be kept from disgrace.

    4: 
Like a eunuch lusting to violate a young woman
    is the one who does right under compulsion.

    5: 
One is silent and is thought wise;
    another, for being talkative, is disliked.

    6: 
One is silent, having nothing to say;
    another is silent, biding his time.

    7: 
The wise remain silent till the right time comes,
    but a boasting fool misses the proper time.

    8: 
Whoever talks too much is detested;
    whoever pretends to authority is hated.

    9: There is the misfortune that brings success;
    and there is the gain that turns into loss.

    10: 
There is the gift that profits you nothing,
    and there is the gift that must be paid back double.

    11: 
There is the loss for the sake of glory,
    and there is the one who rises above humble circumstances.

    12: 
There is one who buys much for little,
    but pays for it seven times over.

    13: 
The wise make themselves beloved by a few words,
    but the courtesies of fools are wasted.

    14: 
A gift from a fool will do you no good,
    for in his eyes this one gift is equal to many.

    15: 
He gives little, criticizes often,
    and opens his mouth like a town crier.
He lends today and asks for it tomorrow;
    such a person is hateful.

    16: 
A fool says, “I have no friends
    nor thanks for my generosity.”
Those who eat his bread have a mocking tongue.

    17: 
How many will ridicule him, and how often!

    18: 
A slip on the floor is better than a slip of the tongue;
    in like manner the downfall of the wicked comes quickly.

18 
A slip on the floor is better than a slip of the tongue;[d]
    in like manner the downfall of the wicked comes quickly.
19 
A coarse person, an untimely story;
    the ignorant are always ready to offer it.
20 
A proverb spoken by a fool is unwelcome,
    for he does not tell it at the proper time.

    21: 
There is a person whose poverty prevents him from sinning,
    but when he takes his rest he has no regrets.

    22: 
There is a person who is destroyed through shame,
    and ruined by foolish posturing.

    23: 
There is one who promises a friend out of shame,
    and so makes an enemy needlessly.

    24: 
A lie is a foul blot in a person,
    yet it is always on the lips of the ignorant.

    25: 
A thief is better than an inveterate liar,
    yet both will suffer ruin.

    26: 
A liar’s way leads to dishonor,
    and his shame remains ever with him.

    27: 
The wise gain promotion with few words,
    the prudent please the great.

    28: 
Those who work the land have abundant crops,
    and those who please the great are pardoned their faults.

    29: 
Favors and gifts blind the eyes;
    like a muzzle over the mouth they silence reproofs.

    30: 
Hidden wisdom and unseen treasure—
    what value has either?

    31: 
Better are those who hide their folly
    than those who hide their wisdom.
