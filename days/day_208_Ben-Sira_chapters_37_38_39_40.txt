Day 208:

Reading Ben-Sira, chapters ['37', '38', '39', '40']:

  Chapter 37.

    1: 
Every friend declares friendship,
    but there are friends who are friends in name only.

    2: 
    3: 
1 
Every friend declares friendship,
    but there are friends who are friends in name only.
2 
Is it not a sorrow unto death
    when your other self becomes your enemy?
3 
“Alas, my companion! Why were you created
    to fill the earth with deceit?”

    4: 
A harmful friend will look to your table,
    but in time of trouble he stands aloof.

    5: 
A good friend will fight with you against the foe,
    and against your enemies he will hold up your shield.

    6: 
    7: 1 
Every friend declares friendship,
    but there are friends who are friends in name only.
2 
Is it not a sorrow unto death
    when your other self becomes your enemy?
3 
“Alas, my companion! Why were you created
    to fill the earth with deceit?”
4 
A harmful friend will look to your table,
    but in time of trouble he stands aloof.
5 
A good friend will fight with you against the foe,
    and against your enemies he will hold up your shield.
6 
Do not forget your comrade during the battle,
    and do not neglect him when you distribute your spoils.
7 
Every counselor points out a way,
    but some counsel ways of their own.

    8: 
Watch out when one offers advice;
    find out first of all what he wants.
For he also may be thinking of himself—
    Why should the opportunity fall to him?

    9: He may tell you how good your way will be,
    and then stand by to see you impoverished.

    10: 
Seek no advice from your father-in-law,
    and from one who is envious of you, keep your intentions hidden.

    11: 
Seek no advice from a woman about her rival,
    from a coward about war,
    from a merchant about business,
    from a buyer about value,
    from a miser about generosity,
    from a cruel person about well-being,
    from a worthless worker about his work,
    from a seasonal laborer about the harvest,
    from an idle slave about a great task—
    pay no attention to any advice they give.

    12: 
Instead, associate with a religious person,
    who you know keeps the commandments;
Who is like-minded with yourself
    and will grieve for you if you fall.

    13: 
Then, too, heed your own heart’s counsel;
    for there is nothing you can depend on more.

    14: 
The heart can reveal your situation
    better than seven sentinels on a tower.

    15: 
Then with all this, pray to God
    to make your steps firm in the true path.
Wisdom and Temperance

    16: 
A word is the source of every deed;
    a thought, of every act.

    17: 
The root of all conduct is the heart;

    18: 
    four branches it shoots forth:
Good and evil, death and life,
    and their absolute mistress is the tongue.

    19: 
One may be wise and benefit many,
    yet appear foolish to himself.

    20: 
One may be wise, but if his words are rejected,
    he will be deprived of all enjoyment.
22 
When one is wise to his own advantage,
    the fruits of knowledge are seen in his own person.
23 
When one is wise to the advantage of people,
    the fruits of knowledge are lasting.
24 
One wise for himself has full enjoyment,
    and all who see him praise him.
25 
The days of one’s life are numbered,
    but the life of Israel, days without number.
26 
One wise among the people wins a heritage of glory,
    and his name lives on and on.
27 
My son, while you are well, govern your appetite,[c]
    and see that you do not allow it what is bad for you.
28 
For not everything is good for everyone,
    nor is everything suited to every taste.
29 
Do not go to excess with any enjoyment,
    neither become a glutton for choice foods;
30 
For sickness comes with overeating,
    and gluttony brings on nausea.
31 
Through lack of self-control many have died,
    but the abstemious one prolongs life.


  Chapter 38.

    1: 
Make friends with the doctor, for he is essential to you;
    God has also established him in his profession.

    2: 
    3: 
Sickness and Death
1 
Make friends with the doctor, for he is essential to you;
    God has also established him in his profession.
2 
From God the doctor has wisdom,
    and from the king he receives sustenance.
3 
Knowledge makes the doctor distinguished,
    and gives access to those in authority.

    4: 
God makes the earth yield healing herbs
    which the prudent should not neglect;

    5: 
Was not the water sweetened by a twig,
    so that all might learn his power?

    6: 
He endows people with knowledge,
    to glory in his mighty works,

    7: 
    8: Sickness and Death
1 
Make friends with the doctor, for he is essential to you;
    God has also established him in his profession.
2 
From God the doctor has wisdom,
    and from the king he receives sustenance.
3 
Knowledge makes the doctor distinguished,
    and gives access to those in authority.
4 
God makes the earth yield healing herbs
    which the prudent should not neglect;
5 
Was not the water sweetened by a twig,
    so that all might learn his power?
6 
He endows people with knowledge,
    to glory in his mighty works,
7 
Through which the doctor eases pain,
8 
    and the druggist prepares his medicines.
Thus God’s work continues without cease
    in its efficacy on the surface of the earth.

    9: My son, when you are ill, do not delay,
    but pray to God, for it is he who heals.

    10: 
Flee wickedness and purify your hands;
    cleanse your heart of every sin.

    11: 
Offer your sweet-smelling oblation and memorial,
    a generous offering according to your means.

    12: 
Then give the doctor his place
    lest he leave; you need him too,

    13: 
For there are times when recovery is in his hands.

    14: 
    He too prays to God
That his diagnosis may be correct
    and his treatment bring about a cure.

    15: 
Whoever is a sinner before his Maker
    will be defiant toward the doctor.

    16: 
My son, shed tears for one who is dead
    with wailing and bitter lament;
As is only proper, prepare the body,
    and do not absent yourself from the burial.

    17: 
Weeping bitterly, mourning fully,
    pay your tribute of sorrow, as deserved:
A day or two, to prevent gossip;
    then compose yourself after your grief.

    18: 
For grief can bring on death,
    and heartache can sap one’s strength.

    19: 
When a person is carried away, sorrow is over;
    and the life of the poor one is grievous to the heart.

    20: 
Do not turn your thoughts to him again;
    cease to recall him; think rather of the end.

    21: 
Do not recall him, for there is no hope of his return;
    you do him no good, and you harm yourself.

    22: 
Remember that his fate will also be yours;
    for him it was yesterday, for you today.

    23: 
With the dead at rest, let memory cease;
    be consoled, once the spirit has gone.
Vocations of the Skilled Worker and the Scribe

    24: 
The scribe’s wisdom increases wisdom;
    whoever is free from toil can become wise.

    25: 
How can one become learned who guides the plow,
    and thrills in wielding the goad like a lance,
Who guides the ox and urges on the bullock,
    and whose every concern is for cattle?

    26: 
His concern is to plow furrows,
    and he is careful to fatten the livestock.

    27: 
So with every engraver and designer
    who, laboring night and day,
Fashions carved seals,
    and whose concern is to vary the pattern.
His determination is to produce a lifelike impression,
    and he is careful to finish the work.

    28: 
So too the smith sitting by the anvil,
    intent on the iron he forges.
The flame from the fire sears his flesh,
    yet he toils away in the furnace heat.
The clang of the hammer deafens his ears;
    his eyes are on the object he is shaping.
His determination is to finish the work,
    and he is careful to perfect it in detail.

    29: 
So also the potter sitting at his labor,
    revolving the wheel with his feet.
He is always concerned for his products,
    and turns them out in quantity.

    30: 
With his hands he molds the clay,
    and with his feet softens it.
His determination is to complete the glazing,
    and he is careful to fire the kiln.

    31: 
All these are skilled with their hands,
    each one an expert at his own work;

    32: 
Without them no city could be lived in,
    and wherever they stay, they do not go hungry.
But they are not sought out for the council of the people,

    33: 
    nor are they prominent in the assembly.
They do not sit on the judge’s bench,
    nor can they understand law and justice.
They cannot expound discipline or judgment,
    nor are they found among the rulers.

    34: 
Yet they maintain the fabric of the world,
    and their concern is for exercise of their skill.


  Chapter 39.

    1: 
He explores the wisdom of all the ancients
    and is occupied with the prophecies;

    2: 
    3: 
How different the person who devotes himself
    to the study of the law of the Most High!
1 
He explores the wisdom of all the ancients
    and is occupied with the prophecies;
2 
He preserves the discourses of the famous,
    and goes to the heart of involved sayings;
3 
He seeks out the hidden meaning of proverbs,
    and is busied with the enigmas found in parables.

    4: 
He is in attendance on the great,
    and appears before rulers.
He travels among the peoples of foreign lands
    to test what is good and evil among people.

    5: 
His care is to rise early
    to seek the Lord his Maker,
    to petition the Most High,
To open his mouth in prayer,
    to ask pardon for his sins.

    6: 
If it pleases the Lord Almighty,
    he will be filled with the spirit of understanding;
He will pour forth his words of wisdom
    and in prayer give praise to the Lord.

    7: 
He will direct his knowledge and his counsel,
    as he meditates upon God’s mysteries.

    8: 
    9: ow different the person who devotes himself
    to the study of the law of the Most High!
1 
He explores the wisdom of all the ancients
    and is occupied with the prophecies;
2 
He preserves the discourses of the famous,
    and goes to the heart of involved sayings;
3 
He seeks out the hidden meaning of proverbs,
    and is busied with the enigmas found in parables.
4 
He is in attendance on the great,
    and appears before rulers.
He travels among the peoples of foreign lands
    to test what is good and evil among people.
5 
His care is to rise early
    to seek the Lord his Maker,
    to petition the Most High,
To open his mouth in prayer,
    to ask pardon for his sins.
6 
If it pleases the Lord Almighty,
    he will be filled with the spirit of understanding;
He will pour forth his words of wisdom
    and in prayer give praise to the Lord.
7 
He will direct his knowledge and his counsel,
    as he meditates upon God’s mysteries.
8 
He will show the wisdom of what he has learned
    and glory in the Law of the Lord’s covenant.
9 
Many will praise his understanding;
    his name can never be blotted out;
Unfading will be his memory,
    through all generations his name will live;

    10: 
Peoples will speak of his wisdom,
    and the assembly will declare his praise.

    11: 
While he lives he is one out of a thousand,
    and when he dies he leaves a good name.
Praise of God the Creator

    12: 
Once more I will set forth my theme
    to shine like the moon in its fullness!

    13: 
Listen to me, my faithful children: open up your petals,
    like roses planted near running waters;

    14: 
Send up the sweet odor of incense,
    break forth in blossoms like the lily.
Raise your voices in a chorus of praise;
    bless the Lord for all his works!

    15: 
Proclaim the greatness of his name,
    loudly sing his praises,
With music on the harp and all stringed instruments;
    sing out with joy as you proclaim:

    16: 
The works of God are all of them good;
    he supplies for every need in its own time.

    17: 
At his word the waters become still as in a flask;
    he had but to speak and the reservoirs were made.

    18: 
He has but to command and his will is done;
    nothing can limit his saving action.

    19: 
The works of all humankind are present to him;
    nothing is hidden from his eyes.

    20: 
His gaze spans all the ages:
    is there any limit to his saving action?
To him, nothing is small or insignificant,
    and nothing too wonderful or hard for him.

    21: 
No cause then to say: “What is the purpose of this?”
    Everything is chosen to satisfy a need.

    22: 
His blessing overflows like the Nile;
    like the Euphrates it enriches the surface of the earth.

    23: 
Even so, his wrath dispossesses the nations
    and turns fertile land into a salt marsh.

    24: 
For the virtuous his paths are level,
    to the haughty they are clogged with stones.

    25: 
Good things for the good he provided from the beginning,
    but for the wicked good things and bad.

    26: 
Chief of all needs for human life
    are water and fire, iron and salt,
The heart of the wheat, milk and honey,
    the blood of the grape, and oil, and clothing.

    27: 
For the good all these are good,
    but for the wicked they turn out evil.

    28: 
There are stormwinds created to punish;
    in their fury they can dislodge mountains.
In a time of destruction they hurl their force
    and calm the anger of their Maker.

    29: 
Fire and hail, famine and disease:
    these too were created for punishment.

    30: 
Ravenous beasts, scorpions, vipers,
    and the avenging sword to exterminate the wicked:
All these were created to meet a need,
    and are kept in his storehouse for the proper time.

    31: 
When he commands them, they rejoice,
    in their assigned tasks they do not disobey his command.

    32: 
That is why from the first I took my stand,
    and wrote down as my theme:

    33: 
The works of God are all of them good;
    he supplies for every need in its own time.

    34: 
There is no cause then to say: “This is not as good as that”;
    for each shows its worth at the proper time.

    35: 
So now with full heart and voice proclaim
    and bless his name!


  Chapter 40.

    1: 
A great anxiety has God allotted,
    and a heavy yoke, to the children of Adam,
From the day they leave their mother’s womb
    until the day they return to the mother of all the living.[b]

    2: 
Troubled thoughts and fear of heart are theirs
    and anxious foreboding until death.

    3: 
    4: 
Joys and Miseries of Life
1 
A great anxiety has God allotted,
    and a heavy yoke, to the children of Adam,
From the day they leave their mother’s womb
    until the day they return to the mother of all the living.[b]
2 
Troubled thoughts and fear of heart are theirs
    and anxious foreboding until death.
3 
Whether one sits on a lofty throne
    or grovels in dust and ashes,
4 
Whether one wears a splendid crown
    or is clothed in the coarsest of garments—

    5: 
There is wrath and envy, trouble and dread,
    terror of death, fury and strife.
Even when one lies on his bed to rest,
    his cares disturb his sleep at night.

    6: 
So short is his rest it seems like none,
    till in his dreams he struggles as he did by day,
Troubled by the visions of his mind,
    like a fugitive fleeing from the pursuer.

    7: 
As he reaches safety, he wakes up,
    astonished that there was nothing to fear.

    8: 
To all flesh, human being and beast,
    but for sinners seven times more,

    9: Come plague and bloodshed, fiery heat and drought,
    plunder and ruin, famine and death.

    10: 
For the wicked evil was created,
    and because of them destruction hastens.

    11: 
All that is of earth returns to earth,
    and what is from above returns above.

    12: 
All that comes from bribes or injustice will be wiped out,
    but loyalty remains forever.

    13: 
Wealth from injustice is like a flooding wadi,
    like a mighty stream with lightning and thunder,

    14: 
Which, in its rising, rolls along the stones,
    but suddenly, once and for all, comes to an end.

    15: 
The offshoot of violence will not flourish,
    for the root of the godless is on sheer rock.

    16: 
They are like reeds on riverbanks,
    withered before all other plants;

    17: 
But goodness, like eternity, will never be cut off,
    and righteousness endures forever.

    18: 
Wealth or wages can make life sweet,
    but better than either, finding a treasure.

    19: 
A child or a city will preserve one’s name,
    but better than either, finding wisdom.
Cattle and orchards make a person flourish;
    but better than either, a devoted wife.

    20: 
Wine and strong drink delight the soul,
    but better than either, love of friends.

    21: 
Flute and harp offer sweet melody,
    but better than either, a pure tongue.

    22: 
Grace and beauty delight the eye,
    but better than either, the produce of the field.

    23: 
A friend and a neighbor are timely guides,
    but better than either, a sensible wife.

    24: 
Relatives and helpers for times of stress;
    but better than either, charity that rescues.

    25: 
Gold and silver make one’s way secure,
    but better than either, sound judgment.

    26: 
Wealth and vigor make the heart exult,
    but better than either, fear of God.
In the fear of the Lord there is no want;
    whoever has it need seek no other support.

    27: 
The fear of God is a paradise of blessings;
    its canopy is over all that is glorious.

    28: 
My son, do not live the life of a beggar;
    better to die than to beg.

    29: 
When one has to look to a stranger’s table,
    life is not worth living.
The delicacies offered bring revulsion of spirit,
    and to the intelligent, inward torture.

    30: 
In the mouth of the shameless begging is sweet,
    but within him it burns like fire.
