Day 215:

Reading Isaiah, chapters ['13', '14', '15', '16']:

  Chapter 13.

    1: 
Babylon. 1 An oracle[c] concerning Babylon; a vision of Isaiah, son of Amoz.

    2: 
    3: Babylon. 1 An oracle[c] concerning Babylon; a vision of Isaiah, son of Amoz.
2 
Upon the bare mountains set up a signal;
    cry out to them,[d]
Beckon for them to enter
    the gates of the nobles.
3 
I have commanded my consecrated ones,[e]
    I have summoned my warriors,
    eager and bold to carry out my anger.

    4: 
Listen! the rumble on the mountains:
    that of an immense throng!
Listen! the noise of kingdoms, nations assembled!
The Lord of hosts is mustering
    an army for battle.

    5: 
They come from a far-off country,
    and from the end of the heavens,
The Lord and the instruments of his wrath,
    to destroy all the land.

    6: 
Howl, for the day of the Lord is near;
    as destruction from the Almighty it comes.

    7: 
Therefore all hands fall helpless,
    every human heart melts,

    8: 
    and they are terrified,
Pangs and sorrows take hold of them,
    like a woman in labor they writhe;
They look aghast at each other,
    their faces aflame.

    9: Indeed, the day of the Lord comes,
    cruel, with wrath and burning anger;
To lay waste the land
    and destroy the sinners within it!

    10: 
The stars of the heavens and their constellations
    will send forth no light;
The sun will be dark at its rising,
    and the moon will not give its light.

    11: 
Thus I will punish the world for its evil
    and the wicked for their guilt.
I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant,
    the insolence of tyrants I will humble.

    12: 
    13: Babylon. 1 An oracle[c] concerning Babylon; a vision of Isaiah, son of Amoz.
2 
Upon the bare mountains set up a signal;
    cry out to them,[d]
Beckon for them to enter
    the gates of the nobles.

    that of an immense throng!
Listen! the noise of kingdoms, nations assembled!
The Lord of hosts is mustering
    an army for battle.
5 
They come from a far-off country,
    and from the end of the heavens,
The Lord and the instruments of his wrath,
    to destroy all the land.
6 
Howl, for the day of the Lord[f] is near;
    as destruction from the Almighty it comes.
7 
Therefore all hands fall helpless,
    every human heart melts,
8 
    and they are terrified,
Pangs and sorrows take hold of them,
    like a woman in labor they writhe;
They look aghast at each other,
    their faces aflame.
9 
Indeed, the day of the Lord comes,
    cruel, with wrath and burning anger;
To lay waste the land
    and destroy the sinners within it!
10 
The stars of the heavens and their constellations
    will send forth no light;
The sun will be dark at its rising,
    and the moon will not give its light.
11 
Thus I will punish the world for its evil
    and the wicked for their guilt.
I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant,
    the insolence of tyrants I will humble.
12 
I will make mortals more rare than pure gold,
    human beings, than the gold of Ophir.[g]
13 
For this I will make the heavens tremble
    and the earth shall be shaken from its place,
At the wrath of the Lord of hosts
    on the day of his burning anger.

    14: 
Like a hunted gazelle,
    or a flock that no one gathers,
They shall turn each to their own people
    and flee each to their own land.

    15: 
Everyone who is taken shall be run through;
    and everyone who is caught shall fall by the sword.

    16: 
Their infants shall be dashed to pieces in their sight;
    their houses shall be plundered
    and their wives ravished.

    17: 
I am stirring up against them the Medes,
    who think nothing of silver
    and take no delight in gold.

    18: 
With their bows they shall shatter the young men,
And the fruit of the womb they shall not spare,
    nor shall their eye take pity on children.

    19: 
And Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms,
    the glory and pride of the Chaldeans,
Shall become like Sodom and Gomorrah,
    overthrown by God.

    20: 
It shall never be inhabited,
    nor dwelt in, from age to age;
Arabians shall not pitch their tents there,
    nor shepherds rest their flocks there.

    21: 
But desert demons shall rest there
    and owls shall fill the houses;
There ostriches shall dwell,
    and satyrs shall dance.

    22: 
Wild dogs shall dwell in its castles,
    and jackals in its luxurious palaces.
Its time is near at hand
    and its days shall not be prolonged.


  Chapter 14.

    1: 
Restoration of Israel. 1 But the Lord will take pity on Jacob and again choose Israel, and will settle them on their own land; foreigners will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob. 
    2: The nations will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them as male and female slaves on the Lord’s land; they will take captive their captors and rule over their oppressors.
Downfall of the King of Babylon. 
    3: 
    4: Restoration of Israel. 1 But the Lord will take pity on Jacob and again choose Israel, and will settle them on their own land; foreigners will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob. 2 The nations will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them as male and female slaves on the Lord’s land; they will take captive their captors and rule over their oppressors.
Downfall of the King of Babylon. 3 On the day when the Lord gives you rest from your sorrow and turmoil, from the hard service with which you served, 4 you will take up this taunt-song[b] against the king of Babylon:
How the oppressor has come to an end!
    how the turmoil has ended!

    5: 
The Lord has broken the rod of the wicked,
    the staff of the tyrants

    6: 
That struck the peoples in wrath
    with relentless blows;
That ruled the nations in anger,
    with boundless persecution.

    7: 
The whole earth rests peacefully,
    song breaks forth;

    8: 
The very cypresses rejoice over you,
    the cedars of Lebanon:
“Now that you are laid to rest,
    no one comes to cut us down.”

    9: Below, Sheol is all astir
    preparing for your coming;
Awakening the shades to greet you,
    all the leaders of the earth;
Making all the kings of the nations
    rise from their thrones.

    10: 
All of them speak out
    and say to you,
“You too have become weak like us,
    you are just like us!

    11: 
Down to Sheol your pomp is brought,
    the sound of your harps.
Maggots are the couch beneath you,
    worms your blanket.”

    12: 
How you have fallen from the heavens,
    O Morning Star, son of the dawn!
How you have been cut down to the earth,
    you who conquered nations!

    13: 
    14: Restoration of Israel. 1 But the Lord will take pity on Jacob and again choose Israel, and will settle them on their own land; foreigners will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob. 2 The nations will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them as male and female slaves on the Lord’s land; they will take captive their captors and rule over their oppressors.
Downfall of the King of Babylon. 3 On the day when the Lord gives you rest from your sorrow and turmoil, from the hard service with which you served, 4 you will take up this taunt-song[b] against the king of Babylon:
How the oppressor has come to an end!
    how the turmoil has ended!
5 
The Lord has broken the rod of the wicked,
    the staff of the tyrants
6 
That struck the peoples in wrath
    with relentless blows;
That ruled the nations in anger,
    with boundless persecution.
7 
The whole earth rests peacefully,
    song breaks forth;
8 
The very cypresses rejoice over you,
    the cedars of Lebanon:
“Now that you are laid to rest,
    no one comes to cut us down.”
9 
Below, Sheol is all astir
    preparing for your coming;
Awakening the shades to greet you,
    all the leaders of the earth;
Making all the kings of the nations
    rise from their thrones.
10 
All of them speak out
    and say to you,
“You too have become weak like us,
    you are just like us!
11 
Down to Sheol your pomp is brought,
    the sound of your harps.
Maggots are the couch beneath you,
    worms your blanket.”
12 
How you have fallen from the heavens,
    O Morning Star,[c] son of the dawn!
How you have been cut down to the earth,
    you who conquered nations!
13 
In your heart you said:
    “I will scale the heavens;
Above the stars of God[d]
    I will set up my throne;
I will take my seat on the Mount of Assembly,
    on the heights of Zaphon.
14 
I will ascend above the tops of the clouds;
    I will be like the Most High!”

    15: 
No! Down to Sheol you will be brought
    to the depths of the pit!

    16: 
When they see you they will stare,
    pondering over you:
“Is this the man who made the earth tremble,
    who shook kingdoms?

    17: 
Who made the world a wilderness,
    razed its cities,
    and gave captives no release?”

    18: 
All the kings of the nations lie in glory,
    each in his own tomb;

    19: 
But you are cast forth without burial,
    like loathsome carrion,
Covered with the slain, with those struck by the sword,
    a trampled corpse,
Going down to the very stones of the pit.

    20: 
    You will never be together with them in the grave,
For you have ruined your land,
    you have slain your people!
Let him never be named,
    that offshoot of evil!

    21: 
Make ready to slaughter his sons
    for the guilt of their fathers;
Lest they rise and possess the earth,
    and fill the breadth of the world with cities.

    22: I will rise up against them, says the Lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, progeny and offspring, says the Lord. 
    23: I will make it a haunt of hoot owls and a marshland; I will sweep it with the broom of destruction, oracle of the Lord of hosts.
God’s Plan for Assyria

    24: 
    The Lord of hosts has sworn:
As I have resolved,
    so shall it be;
As I have planned,
    so shall it stand:

    25: 
To break the Assyrian in my land
    and trample him on my mountains;
Then his yoke shall be removed from them,
    and his burden from their shoulder.

    26: 
This is the plan proposed for the whole earth,
    and this the hand outstretched over all the nations.

    27: 
The Lord of hosts has planned;
    who can thwart him?
His hand is stretched out;
    who can turn it back?
Philistia. 
    28: In the year that King Ahaz died, there came this oracle:

    29: 
Do not rejoice, Philistia, not one of you,
    that the rod which struck you is broken;
For out of the serpent’s root shall come an adder,
    its offspring shall be a flying saraph.

    30: 
In my pastures the poor shall graze,
    and the needy lie down in safety;
But I will kill your root with famine
    that shall slay even your remnant.

    31: 
Howl, O gate; cry out, O city!
    Philistia, all of you melts away!
For there comes a smoke from the north,
    without a straggler in its ranks.

    32: 
What will one answer the messengers of the nations?
    “The Lord has established Zion,
    and in her the afflicted of his people find refuge.”


  Chapter 15.

    1: 
Moab
1 
    Oracle on Moab:
Laid waste in a night,
    Ar of Moab is destroyed;
Laid waste in a night,
    Kir of Moab is destroyed.

    2: 
Daughter Dibon has gone up
    to the high places to weep;
Over Nebo and over Medeba
    Moab is wailing.
Every head is shaved,
    every beard sheared off.

    3: 
In the streets they wear sackcloth,
    and on the rooftops;
In the squares
    everyone wails, streaming with tears.

    4: 
    5: Moab
1 
    Oracle on Moab:
Laid waste in a night,
    Ar of Moab is destroyed;
Laid waste in a night,
    Kir of Moab is destroyed.
2 
Daughter Dibon has gone up
    to the high places to weep;
Over Nebo and over Medeba
    Moab is wailing.
Every head is shaved,
    every beard sheared off.[b]
3 
In the streets they wear sackcloth,
    and on the rooftops;
In the squares
    everyone wails, streaming with tears.
4 
Heshbon and Elealeh cry out,
    they are heard as far as Jahaz.
At this the loins of Moab tremble,
    his soul quivers within him;
5 
My heart cries out for Moab,
    his fugitives reach Zoar,
    Eglath-shelishiyah:
The ascent of Luhith
    they ascend weeping;
On the way to Horonaim
    they utter rending cries;

    6: 
The waters of Nimrim
    have become a waste,
The grass is withered,
    new growth is gone,
    nothing is green.

    7: 
So now whatever they have acquired or stored away
    they carry across the Wadi of the Poplars.

    8: 
The cry has gone round
    the territory of Moab;
As far as Eglaim his wailing,
    even at Beer-elim his wailing.

    9: The waters of Dimon are filled with blood,
    but I will bring still more upon Dimon:
Lions for those who are fleeing from Moab
    and for those who remain in the land!


  Chapter 16.

    1: 
1 
Send them forth, hugging the earth like reptiles,
    from Sela across the desert,
    to the mount of daughter Zion.

    2: 
Like flushed birds,
    like scattered nestlings,
Are the daughters of Moab
    at the fords of the Arnon.

    3: 
Offer counsel, take their part;
    at high noon make your shade like the night;
Hide the outcasts,
    do not betray the fugitives.

    4: 
Let the outcasts of Moab live with you,
    be their shelter from the destroyer.
When there is an end to the oppressor,
    when destruction has ceased,
    and the marauders have vanished from the land,

    5: 
    6: 1 
Send them forth, hugging the earth like reptiles,
    from Sela across the desert,
    to the mount of daughter Zion.
2 
Like flushed birds,
    like scattered nestlings,
Are the daughters of Moab
    at the fords of the Arnon.[b]
3 
[c]Offer counsel, take their part;
    at high noon make your shade like the night;
Hide the outcasts,
    do not betray the fugitives.
4 
Let the outcasts of Moab live with you,
    be their shelter from the destroyer.
When there is an end to the oppressor,
    when destruction has ceased,
    and the marauders have vanished from the land,
5 
A throne shall be set up in mercy,
    and on it shall sit in fidelity,
    in David’s tent,
A judge upholding right,
    prompt to do justice.
6 
We have heard of the pride of Moab,
    how very proud he is,
Of his haughtiness, pride, and arrogance
    that his empty words do not match.

    7: 
Therefore let Moab wail,
    let everyone wail for Moab;
For the raisin cakes[e] of Kir-hareseth
    let them sigh, stricken with grief.

    8: 
The terraced slopes of Heshbon languish,
    the vines of Sibmah,
Whose clusters once overpowered
    the lords of nations,
Reaching as far as Jazer
    winding through the wilderness,
Whose branches spread forth,
    crossing over the sea.

    9: Therefore I weep with Jazer
    for the vines of Sibmah;
I drench you with my tears,
    Heshbon and Elealeh;
For on your summer fruits and harvests
    the battle cry has fallen.

    10: 
From the orchards are taken away
    joy and gladness,
In the vineyards there is no singing,
    no shout of joy;
In the wine presses no one treads grapes,
    the vintage shout is stilled.

    11: 
Therefore for Moab
    my heart moans like a lyre,
    my inmost being for Kir-hareseth.

    12: 
When Moab wears himself out on the high places,
    and enters his sanctuary to pray,
    it shall avail him nothing.

    13: That is the word the Lord spoke against Moab in times past. 
    14: But now the Lord speaks: In three years, like the years of a hired laborer, the glory of Moab shall be empty despite all its great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and weak.
