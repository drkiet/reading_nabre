Day 214:

Reading Isaiah, chapters ['9', '10', '11', '12']:

  Chapter 9.

    1: 
The people who walked in darkness
    have seen a great light;
Upon those who lived in a land of gloom
    a light has shone.

    2: 
You have brought them abundant joy
    and great rejoicing;
They rejoice before you as people rejoice at harvest,
    as they exult when dividing the spoils.

    3: 
For the yoke that burdened them,
    the pole on their shoulder,
The rod of their taskmaster,
    you have smashed, as on the day of Midian.

    4: 
For every boot that tramped in battle,
    every cloak rolled in blood,
    will be burned as fuel for fire.

    5: 
For a child is born to us, a son is given to us;
    upon his shoulder dominion rests.
They name him Wonder-Counselor, God-Hero,
    Father-Forever, Prince of Peace.

    6: 
His dominion is vast
    and forever peaceful,
Upon David’s throne, and over his kingdom,
    which he confirms and sustains
By judgment and justice,
    both now and forever.
The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this!
Judgment on the Northern Kingdom

    7: 
The Lord has sent a word against Jacob,
    and it falls upon Israel;

    8: 
    9:  
The people who walked in darkness
    have seen a great light;
Upon those who lived in a land of gloom
    a light has shone.
2 
You have brought them abundant joy
    and great rejoicing;
They rejoice before you as people rejoice at harvest,
    as they exult when dividing the spoils.
3 
For the yoke that burdened them,
    the pole on their shoulder,
The rod of their taskmaster,
    you have smashed, as on the day of Midian.
4 
For every boot that tramped in battle,
    every cloak rolled in blood,
    will be burned as fuel for fire.
5 
For a child[b] is born to us, a son is given to us;
    upon his shoulder dominion rests.
They name him Wonder-Counselor, God-Hero,
    Father-Forever, Prince of Peace.
6 
His dominion is vast
    and forever peaceful,
Upon David’s throne, and over his kingdom,
    which he confirms and sustains
By judgment and justice,
    both now and forever.
The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this!
Judgment on the Northern Kingdom[c]
7 
The Lord has sent a word against Jacob,
    and it falls upon Israel;
8 
And all the people know it—
    Ephraim and those who dwell in Samaria—
    those who say in arrogance and pride of heart,
9 
“Bricks have fallen,
    but we will rebuild with cut stone;
Sycamores have been felled,
    but we will replace them with cedars.”

    10: 
So the Lord raises up their foes against them
    and stirs up their enemies to action—

    11: 
Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west—
    they devour Israel with open mouth.
For all this, his wrath is not turned back,
    and his hand is still outstretched!

    12: 
The people do not turn back to the one who struck them,
    nor do they seek the Lord of hosts.

    13: 
So the Lord cuts off from Israel head and tail,
    palm branch and reed in one day.

    14: 
(The elder and the noble are the head,
    the prophet who teaches falsehood is the tail.)

    15: 
Those who lead this people lead them astray,
    and those who are led are swallowed up.

    16: 
That is why the Lord does not spare their young men,
    and their orphans and widows he does not pity;
For they are totally impious and wicked,
    and every mouth speaks folly.
For all this, his wrath is not turned back,
    his hand is still outstretched!

    17: 
For wickedness burns like fire,
    devouring brier and thorn;
It kindles the forest thickets,
    which go up in columns of smoke.

    18: 
At the wrath of the Lord of hosts the land quakes,
    and the people are like fuel for fire;
    no one spares his brother.

    19: 
They hack on the right, but remain hungry;
    they devour on the left, but are not filled.
    Each devours the flesh of the neighbor;

    20: 
Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh,
    together they turn on Judah.
For all this, his wrath is not turned back,
    his hand is still outstretched!


  Chapter 10.

    1: 
Perversion of Justice
1 
Ah! Those who enact unjust statutes,
    who write oppressive decrees,

    2: 
Depriving the needy of judgment,
    robbing my people’s poor of justice,
Making widows their plunder,
    and orphans their prey!

    3: 
What will you do on the day of punishment,
    when the storm comes from afar?
To whom will you flee for help?
    Where will you leave your wealth,

    4: 
Lest it sink beneath the captive
    or fall beneath the slain?
For all this, his wrath is not turned back,
    his hand is still outstretched!
Judgment on Assyria

    5: 
Ah! Assyria, the rod of my wrath,
    the staff I wield in anger.

    6: 
Against an impious nation I send him,
    and against a people under my wrath I order him
To seize plunder, carry off loot,
    and to trample them like the mud of the street.

    7: 
But this is not what he intends,
    nor does he have this in mind;
Rather, it is in his heart to destroy,
    to make an end of not a few nations.

    8: 
For he says, “Are not my commanders all kings?”

    9: 
    10: Perversion of Justice
1 
Ah! Those who enact unjust statutes,
    who write oppressive decrees,
2 
Depriving the needy of judgment,
    robbing my people’s poor of justice,
Making widows their plunder,
    and orphans their prey!
3 
What will you do on the day of punishment,
    when the storm comes from afar?
To whom will you flee for help?
    Where will you leave your wealth,
4 
Lest it sink beneath the captive
    or fall beneath the slain?
For all this, his wrath is not turned back,
    his hand is still outstretched![b]
Judgment on Assyria
5 
[c]Ah! Assyria, the rod of my wrath,
    the staff I wield in anger.
6 
Against an impious nation[d] I send him,
    and against a people under my wrath I order him
To seize plunder, carry off loot,
    and to trample them like the mud of the street.
7 
But this is not what he intends,
    nor does he have this in mind;
Rather, it is in his heart to destroy,
    to make an end of not a few nations.
8 
For he says, “Are not my commanders all kings?”
9 
    [e]“Is not Calno like Carchemish,
Or Hamath like Arpad,
    or Samaria like Damascus?
10 
Just as my hand reached out to idolatrous kingdoms
    that had more images than Jerusalem and Samaria—

    11: 
Just as I treated Samaria and her idols,
    shall I not do to Jerusalem and her graven images?”

    12: But when the Lord has brought to an end all his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,
I will punish the utterance
    of the king of Assyria’s proud heart,
    and the boastfulness of his haughty eyes.

    13: 
For he says:
“By my own power I have done it,
    and by my wisdom, for I am shrewd.
I have moved the boundaries of peoples,
    their treasures I have pillaged,
    and, like a mighty one, I have brought down the enthroned.

    14: 
My hand has seized, like a nest,
    the wealth of nations.
As one takes eggs left alone,
    so I took in all the earth;
No one fluttered a wing,
    or opened a mouth, or chirped!”

    15: 
Will the ax boast against the one who hews with it?
    Will the saw exalt itself above the one who wields it?
As if a rod could sway the one who lifts it,
    or a staff could lift the one who is not wood!

    16: 
Therefore the Lord, the Lord of hosts,
    will send leanness among his fat ones,
And under his glory there will be a kindling
    like the kindling of fire.

    17: 
The Light of Israel will become a fire,
    the Holy One, a flame,
That burns and consumes its briers
    and its thorns in a single day.

    18: 
And the glory of its forests and orchards
    will be consumed, soul and body,
    and it will be like a sick man who wastes away.

    19: 
And the remnant of the trees in his forest
    will be so few,
    that any child can record them.

    20: 
    On that day
The remnant of Israel,
    the survivors of the house of Jacob,
    will no more lean upon the one who struck them;
But they will lean upon the Lord,
    the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

    21: 
A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob,
    to the mighty God.

    22: 
Though your people, O Israel,
    were like the sand of the sea,
Only a remnant of them will return;
    their destruction is decreed,
    as overflowing justice demands.

    23: For the Lord, the God of hosts, is about to carry out the destruction decreed in the midst of the whole land.

    24: Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of hosts: My people, who dwell in Zion, do not fear the Assyrian, though he strikes you with a rod, and raises his staff against you as did the Egyptians. 
    25: For just a brief moment more, and my wrath shall be over, and my anger shall be set for their destruction. 
    26: Then the Lord of hosts will raise against them a scourge such as struck Midian at the rock of Oreb; and he will raise his staff over the sea as he did in Egypt. 
    27: On that day,
His burden shall be taken from your shoulder,
    and his yoke shattered from your neck.
The March of an Enemy Army
He has come up from Rimmon,

    28: 
    he has reached Aiath, passed through Migron,
    at Michmash he has stored his supplies.

    29: 
He has crossed the ravine,
    at Geba he has camped for the night.
Ramah trembles,
    Gibeah of Saul has fled.

    30: 
Cry and shriek, Bath-Gallim!
    Hearken, Laishah! Answer her, Anathoth!

    31: 
Madmenah is in flight,
    the inhabitants of Gebim seek refuge.

    32: 
Even today he will halt at Nob,
    he will shake his fist at the mount of daughter Zion,
    the hill of Jerusalem!

    33: 
Now the Lord, the Lord of hosts,
    is about to lop off the boughs with terrible violence;
The tall of stature shall be felled,
    and the lofty ones shall be brought low;

    34: 
He shall hack down the forest thickets with an ax,
    and Lebanon in its splendor shall fall.


  Chapter 11.

    1: 
The Ideal Davidic King[b]
1 
But a shoot shall sprout from the stump[c] of Jesse,
    and from his roots a bud shall blossom.

    2: 
The spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him:
    a spirit of wisdom and of understanding,
A spirit of counsel and of strength,
    a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the Lord,

    3: 
    and his delight shall be the fear of the Lord.
Not by appearance shall he judge,
    nor by hearsay shall he decide,

    4: 
But he shall judge the poor with justice,
    and decide fairly for the land’s afflicted.
He shall strike the ruthless with the rod of his mouth,
    and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked.

    5: 
Justice shall be the band around his waist,
    and faithfulness a belt upon his hips.

    6: 
Then the wolf shall be a guest of the lamb,
    and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat;
The calf and the young lion shall browse together,
    with a little child to guide them.

    7: 
The cow and the bear shall graze,
    together their young shall lie down;
    the lion shall eat hay like the ox.

    8: 
The baby shall play by the viper’s den,
    and the child lay his hand on the adder’s lair.

    9: They shall not harm or destroy on all my holy mountain;
    for the earth shall be filled with knowledge of the Lord,
    as water covers the sea.
Restoration

    10: 
    11: a]
The Ideal Davidic King[b]
1 
But a shoot shall sprout from the stump[c] of Jesse,
    and from his roots a bud shall blossom.
2 
[d]The spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him:
    a spirit of wisdom and of understanding,
A spirit of counsel and of strength,
    a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the Lord,
3 
    and his delight shall be the fear of the Lord.
Not by appearance shall he judge,
    nor by hearsay shall he decide,
4 
But he shall judge the poor with justice,
    and decide fairly for the land’s afflicted.
He shall strike the ruthless with the rod of his mouth,
    and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked.
5 
Justice shall be the band around his waist,
    and faithfulness a belt upon his hips.
6 
[e]Then the wolf shall be a guest of the lamb,
    and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat;
The calf and the young lion shall browse together,
    with a little child to guide them.
7

    the lion shall eat hay like the ox.
8

    and the child lay his hand on the adder’s lair.
9 
They shall not harm or destroy on all my holy mountain;
    for the earth shall be filled with knowledge of the Lord,
    as water covers the sea.
Restoration[f]
10 
    On that day,
The root of Jesse,
    set up as a signal for the peoples—
Him the nations will seek out;
    his dwelling shall be glorious.
11 
    On that day,
The Lord shall again take it in hand
    to reclaim the remnant of his people
    that is left from Assyria and Egypt,
Pathros, Ethiopia, and Elam,
    Shinar, Hamath, and the isles of the sea.

    12: 
He shall raise a signal to the nations
    and gather the outcasts of Israel;
The dispersed of Judah he shall assemble
    from the four corners of the earth.

    13: 
The envy of Ephraim shall pass away,
    and those hostile to Judah shall be cut off;
Ephraim shall not envy Judah,
    and Judah shall not be hostile to Ephraim;

    14: 
But they shall swoop down on the foothills
    of the Philistines to the west,
    together they shall plunder the people of the east;
Edom and Moab shall be their possessions,
    and the Ammonites their subjects.

    15: 
The Lord shall dry up the tongue of the Sea of Egypt,
    and wave his hand over the Euphrates with his fierce wind,
And divide it into seven streamlets,
    so that it can be crossed in sandals.

    16: 
There shall be a highway for the remnant of his people
    that is left from Assyria,
As there was for Israel
    when it came up from the land of Egypt.

    1: 
    2: Song of Thanksgiving
1 
    On that day, you will say:
I give you thanks, O Lord;
    though you have been angry with me,
    your anger has abated, and you have consoled me.
2 
God indeed is my salvation;
    I am confident and unafraid.
For the Lord is my strength and my might,
    and he has been my salvation.

    3: 
With joy you will draw water
    from the fountains of salvation,

    4: 
And you will say on that day:
    give thanks to the Lord, acclaim his name;
Among the nations make known his deeds,
    proclaim how exalted is his name.

    5: 
Sing praise to the Lord for he has done glorious things;
    let this be known throughout all the earth.

    6: 
Shout with exultation, City of Zion,
    for great in your midst
    is the Holy One of Israel!
