Day 221:

Reading Isaiah, chapters ['37', '38', '39', '40']:

  Chapter 37.

    1: When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord. 
    2: 
    3: 
1 When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord. 2 He sent Eliakim, the master of the palace, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to tell the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz,
3 
“Thus says Hezekiah:
A day of distress and rebuke,
    a day of disgrace is this day!
Children are due to come forth,
    but the strength to give birth is lacking.[b]

    4: Perhaps the Lord, your God, will hear the words of the commander, whom his lord, the king of Assyria, sent to taunt the living God, and will rebuke him for the words which the Lord, your God, has heard. So lift up a prayer for the remnant that is here.”

    5: When the servants of King Hezekiah had come to Isaiah, 
    6: 
    7: 1 When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord. 2 He sent Eliakim, the master of the palace, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to tell the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz,
3 
“Thus says Hezekiah:
A day of distress and rebuke,
    a day of disgrace is this day!
Children are due to come forth,
    but the strength to give birth is lacking.[b]
4 Perhaps the Lord, your God, will hear the words of the commander, whom his lord, the king of Assyria, sent to taunt the living God, and will rebuke him for the words which the Lord, your God, has heard. So lift up a prayer for the remnant that is here.”
5 When the servants of King Hezekiah had come to Isaiah, 6 he said to them: “Tell this to your lord: Thus says the Lord: Do not be frightened by the words you have heard, by which the deputies of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
7 
I am putting in him such a spirit
    that when he hears a report
    he will return to his land.
    I will make him fall by the sword in his land.”

    8: When the commander, on his return, heard that the king of Assyria had withdrawn from Lachish, he found him besieging Libnah. 
    9: he king of Assyria heard a report: “Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, has come out to fight against you.” Again he sent messengers to Hezekiah to say: 
    10: “Thus shall you say to Hezekiah, king of Judah: Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by saying, ‘Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.’ 
    11: You, certainly, have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands: they put them under the ban! And are you to be delivered? 
    12: Did the gods of the nations whom my fathers destroyed deliver them—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the Edenites in Telassar? 
    13: Where are the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, or a king of the cities Sepharvaim, Hena or Ivvah?”

    14: Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; then he went up to the house of the Lord, and spreading it out before the Lord, 
    15: Hezekiah prayed to the Lord:

    16: 
“Lord of hosts, God of Israel,
    enthroned on the cherubim!
You alone are God
    over all the kingdoms of the earth.
It is you who made
    the heavens and the earth.

    17: 
Incline your ear, Lord, and listen!
    open your eyes, Lord, and see!
Hear all the words Sennacherib has sent
    to taunt the living God.

    18: 
Truly, O Lord,
    the kings of Assyria have laid waste
    the nations and their lands.

    19: 
They gave their gods to the fire
    —they were not gods at all,
    but the work of human hands—
Wood and stone, they destroyed them.

    20: 
Therefore, Lord, our God,
    save us from this man’s power,
That all the kingdoms of the earth may know
    that you alone, Lord, are God.”

    21: Then Isaiah, son of Amoz, sent this message to Hezekiah: “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you have prayed concerning Sennacherib, king of Assyria: I have listened! 
    22: This is the word the Lord has spoken concerning him:
She despises you, laughs you to scorn,
    the virgin daughter Zion;
Behind you she wags her head,
    daughter Jerusalem.

    23: 
Whom have you insulted and blasphemed,
    at whom have you raised your voice
And lifted up your eyes on high?
    At the Holy One of Israel!

    24: 
Through the mouths of your messengers
    you have insulted the Lord when you said:
‘With my many chariots I went up
    to the tops of the peaks,
    to the recesses of Lebanon,
To cut down its lofty cedars,
    its choice cypresses;
I reached the farthest shelter,
    the forest ranges.

    25: 
I myself dug wells
    and drank foreign water;
Drying up all the rivers of Egypt
    beneath the soles of my feet.’

    26: 
Have you not heard?
    A long time ago I prepared it,
    from days of old I planned it,
Now I have brought it about:
    You are here to reduce
    fortified cities to heaps of ruins,

    27: 
Their people powerless,
    dismayed and distraught,
They are plants of the field,
    green growth,
    thatch on the rooftops,
Grain scorched by the east wind.

    28: 
I know when you stand or sit,
    when you come or go,
    and how you rage against me.

    29: 
Because you rage against me
    and your smugness has reached my ears,
I will put my hook in your nose
    and my bit in your mouth,
And make you leave by the way you came.

    30: 
This shall be a sign for you:
This year you shall eat the aftergrowth,
    next year, what grows of itself;
But in the third year, sow and reap,
    plant vineyards and eat their fruit!

    31: 
The remaining survivors of the house of Judah
    shall again strike root below
    and bear fruit above.

    32: 
For out of Jerusalem shall come a remnant,
    and from Mount Zion, survivors.
The zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.

    33: Therefore, thus says the Lord about the king of Assyria:
He shall not come as far as this city,
    nor shoot there an arrow,
    nor confront it with a shield,
Nor cast up a siege-work against it.

    34: 
By the way he came he shall leave,
    never coming as far as this city,
    oracle of the Lord.

    35: 
I will shield and save this city
    for my own sake and the sake of David my servant.”

    36: 
    37: 1 When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord. 2 He sent Eliakim, the master of the palace, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to tell the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz,
3 
“Thus says Hezekiah:
A day of distress and rebuke,
    a day of disgrace is this day!
Children are due to come forth,
    but the strength to give birth is lacking.[b]
4 Perhaps the Lord, your God, will hear the words of the commander, whom his lord, the king of Assyria, sent to taunt the living God, and will rebuke him for the words which the Lord, your God, has heard. So lift up a prayer for the remnant that is here.”
5 When the servants of King Hezekiah had come to Isaiah, 6 he said to them: “Tell this to your lord: Thus says the Lord: Do not be frightened by the words you have heard, by which the deputies of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
7 
I am putting in him such a spirit
    that when he hears a report
    he will return to his land.
    I will make him fall by the sword in his land.”
8 When the commander, on his return, heard that the king of Assyria had withdrawn from Lachish, he found him besieging Libnah. 9 The king of Assyria heard a report: “Tirhakah,[c] king of Ethiopia, has come out to fight against you.” Again he sent messengers to Hezekiah to say: 10 “Thus shall you say to Hezekiah, king of Judah: Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by saying, ‘Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.’ 11 You, certainly, have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands: they put them under the ban! And are you to be delivered? 12 Did the gods of the nations whom my fathers destroyed deliver them—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the Edenites in Telassar? 13 Where are the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, or a king of the cities Sepharvaim, Hena or Ivvah?”
14 Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; then he went up to the house of the Lord, and spreading it out before the Lord, 15 Hezekiah prayed to the Lord:
16 
“Lord of hosts, God of Israel,
    enthroned on the cherubim!
You alone are God
    over all the kingdoms of the earth.
It is you who made
    the heavens and the earth.[d]
17 
Incline your ear, Lord, and listen!
    open your eyes, Lord, and see!
Hear all the words Sennacherib has sent
    to taunt the living God.
18 
Truly, O Lord,
    the kings of Assyria have laid waste
    the nations and their lands.
19 
They gave their gods to the fire
    —they were not gods at all,
    but the work of human hands—
Wood and stone, they destroyed them.
20 
Therefore, Lord, our God,
    save us from this man’s power,
That all the kingdoms of the earth may know
    that you alone, Lord, are God.”
21 [e]Then Isaiah, son of Amoz, sent this message to Hezekiah: “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you have prayed concerning Sennacherib, king of Assyria: I have listened! 22 This is the word the Lord has spoken concerning him:
She despises you, laughs you to scorn,
    the virgin daughter Zion;
Behind you she wags her head,
    daughter Jerusalem.
23 
Whom have you insulted and blasphemed,
    at whom have you raised your voice
And lifted up your eyes on high?
    At the Holy One of Israel!
24 
Through the mouths of your messengers
    you have insulted the Lord when you said:
‘With my many chariots I went up
    to the tops of the peaks,
    to the recesses of Lebanon,
To cut down its lofty cedars,

25 
I myself dug wells
    and drank foreign water;
Drying up all the rivers of Egypt
    beneath the soles of my feet.’
26 
Have you not heard?
    A long time ago I prepared it,
    from days of old I planned it,
Now I have brought it about:
    You are here to reduce
    fortified cities to heaps of ruins,
27 
Their people powerless,
    dismayed and distraught,
They are plants of the field,
    green growth,
    thatch on the rooftops,
Grain scorched by the east wind.
28 
I know when you stand or sit,
    when you come or go,
    and how you rage against me.
29 
Because you rage against me
    and your smugness has reached my ears,
I will put my hook in your nose
    and my bit in your mouth,
And make you leave by the way you came.
30 
This shall be a sign[f] for you:
This year you shall eat the aftergrowth,
    next year, what grows of itself;
But in the third year, sow and reap,
    plant vineyards and eat their fruit!
31 
The remaining survivors of the house of Judah
    shall again strike root below
    and bear fruit above.
32 
For out of Jerusalem shall come a remnant,
    and from Mount Zion, survivors.
The zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.
33 Therefore, thus says the Lord about the king of Assyria:
He shall not come as far as this city,
    nor shoot there an arrow,
    nor confront it with a shield,
Nor cast up a siege-work against it.
34 
By the way he came he shall leave,
    never coming as far as this city,
    oracle of the Lord.
35 
I will shield and save this city
    for my own sake and the sake of David my servant.”
36 Then the angel of the Lord went forth and struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp. Early the next morning, there they were, all those corpses, dead![g] 37 So Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, broke camp, departed, returned home, and stayed in Nineveh.

    38: When he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword and fled into the land of Ararat. His son Esarhaddon reigned in his place.


  Chapter 38.

    1: In those days,[b] when Hezekiah was mortally ill, the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, came and said to him: “Thus says the Lord: Put your house in order, for you are about to die; you shall not recover.” 
    2: 
    3: 
Sickness and Recovery of Hezekiah. 1 In those days,[b] when Hezekiah was mortally ill, the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, came and said to him: “Thus says the Lord: Put your house in order, for you are about to die; you shall not recover.” 2 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord:
3 “Ah, Lord, remember how faithfully and wholeheartedly I conducted myself in your presence, doing what was good in your sight!” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.

    4: Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah: 
    5: Go, tell Hezekiah: Thus says the Lord, the God of your father David: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Now I will add fifteen years to your life. 
    6: I will rescue you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; I will be a shield to this city.

    7: 
    8: Sickness and Recovery of Hezekiah. 1 In those days,[b] when Hezekiah was mortally ill, the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, came and said to him: “Thus says the Lord: Put your house in order, for you are about to die; you shall not recover.” 2 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord:
3 “Ah, Lord, remember how faithfully and wholeheartedly I conducted myself in your presence, doing what was good in your sight!” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
4 Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah: 5 Go, tell Hezekiah:[c] Thus says the Lord, the God of your father David: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Now I will add fifteen years to your life. 6 I will rescue you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; I will be a shield to this city.
7 This will be the sign for you from the Lord that the Lord will carry out the word he has spoken: 8 See, I will make the shadow cast by the sun on the stairway to the terrace of Ahaz[d] go back the ten steps it has advanced. So the sun came back the ten steps it had advanced.
Hezekiah’s Hymn of Thanksgiving. 
    9: he song of Hezekiah, king of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered from his illness:

    10: 
In the noontime of life I said,
    I must depart!
To the gates of Sheol I have been consigned
    for the rest of my years.

    11: 
I said, I shall see the Lord no more
    in the land of the living.
Nor look on any mortals
    among those who dwell in the world.

    12: 
My dwelling, like a shepherd’s tent,
    is struck down and borne away from me;
You have folded up my life, like a weaver
    who severs me from the last thread.
From morning to night you make an end of me;

    13: 
    I cry out even until the dawn.
Like a lion he breaks all my bones;
    from morning to night you make an end of me.

    14: 
Like a swallow I chirp;
    I moan like a dove.
My eyes grow weary looking heavenward:
    Lord, I am overwhelmed; go security for me!

    15: 
What am I to say or tell him?
    He is the one who has done it!
All my sleep has fled,
    because of the bitterness of my soul.

    16: 
Those live whom the Lord protects;
    yours is the life of my spirit.
You have given me health and restored my life!

    17: 
    Peace in place of bitterness!
You have preserved my life
    from the pit of destruction;
Behind your back
    you cast all my sins.

    18: 
For it is not Sheol that gives you thanks,
    nor death that praises you;
Neither do those who go down into the pit
    await your kindness.

    19: 
The living, the living give you thanks,
    as I do today.
Parents declare to their children,
    O God, your faithfulness.

    20: 
The Lord is there to save us.
    We shall play our music
In the house of the Lord
    all the days of our life.

    21: Then Isaiah said, “Bring a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil for his recovery.” 
    22: Hezekiah asked, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord?”


  Chapter 39.

    1: At that time Merodach-baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and gifts to Hezekiah, when he heard that he had been sick and had recovered. 
    2: 
    3: 
Embassy from Merodach-baladan. 1 At that time Merodach-baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and gifts to Hezekiah, when he heard that he had been sick and had recovered. 2 Hezekiah was pleased at their coming, and then showed the messengers his treasury, the silver and gold, the spices and perfumed oil, his whole armory, and everything in his storerooms; there was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say to you? Where did they come from?” Hezekiah replied, “They came to me from a distant land, from Babylon.” 
    4: He asked, “What did they see in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They saw everything in my house. There is nothing in my storerooms that I did not show them.” 
    5: Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: 
    6: The time is coming when all that is in your house, everything that your ancestors have stored up until this day, shall be carried off to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the Lord. 
    7: Some of your own descendants, your progeny, shall be taken and made attendants in the palace of the king of Babylon.” 
    8: 
    9: mbassy from Merodach-baladan. 1 At that time Merodach-baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and gifts to Hezekiah, when he heard that he had been sick and had recovered. 2 Hezekiah was pleased at their coming, and then showed the messengers his treasury, the silver and gold, the spices and perfumed oil, his whole armory, and everything in his storerooms; there was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say to you? Where did they come from?” Hezekiah replied, “They came to me from a distant land, from Babylon.” 4 He asked, “What did they see in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They saw everything in my house. There is nothing in my storerooms that I did not show them.” 5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: 6 The time is coming when all that is in your house, everything that your ancestors have stored up until this day, shall be carried off to Babylon;[b] nothing shall be left, says the Lord. 7 Some of your own descendants, your progeny, shall be taken and made attendants in the palace of the king of Babylon.” 8 Hezekiah replied to Isaiah, “The word of the Lord which you have spoken is good.”[c] For he thought, “There will be peace and stability in my lifetime.”


  Chapter 40.

    1: 
Comfort, give comfort to my people,
    says your God.

    2: 
Speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and proclaim to her
    that her service has ended,
    that her guilt is expiated,
That she has received from the hand of the Lord
    double for all her sins.

    3:

    5: 
A. The Lord’s Glory in Israel’s Liberation
Chapter 40
Promise of Salvation
1 
[b]Comfort, give comfort to my people,
    says your God.
2 
Speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and proclaim to her
    that her service[c] has ended,
    that her guilt is expiated,
That she has received from the hand of the Lord
    double for all her sins.
3 
    A voice proclaims:[d]
In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord!
    Make straight in the wasteland a highway for our God!
4 
Every valley shall be lifted up,
    every mountain and hill made low;
The rugged land shall be a plain,
    the rough country, a broad valley.
5 
Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,
    and all flesh shall see it together;
    for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.

    6: 
A voice says, “Proclaim!”
    I answer, “What shall I proclaim?”
“All flesh is grass,
    and all their loyalty like the flower of the field.

    7: 
The grass withers, the flower wilts,
    when the breath of the Lord blows upon it.”
“Yes, the people is grass!

    8: 
    The grass withers, the flower wilts,
    but the word of our God stands forever.”

    9: Go up onto a high mountain,
    Zion, herald of good news!
Cry out at the top of your voice,
    Jerusalem, herald of good news!
Cry out, do not fear!
    Say to the cities of Judah:
    Here is your God!

    10: 
Here comes with power
    the Lord God,
    who rules by his strong arm;
Here is his reward with him,
    his recompense before him.

    11: 
Like a shepherd he feeds his flock;
    in his arms he gathers the lambs,
Carrying them in his bosom,
    leading the ewes with care.
Power of God and the Vanity of Idols

    12: 
Who has measured with his palm the waters,
    marked off the heavens with a span,
    held in his fingers the dust of the earth,
    weighed the mountains in scales
    and the hills in a balance?

    13: 
Who has directed the spirit of the Lord,
    or instructed him as his counselor?

    14: 
Whom did he consult to gain knowledge?
    Who taught him the path of judgment,
    or showed him the way of understanding?

    15: 
See, the nations count as a drop in the bucket,
    as a wisp of cloud on the scales;
    the coastlands weigh no more than a speck.

    16: 
Lebanon would not suffice for fuel,
    nor its animals be enough for burnt offerings.

    17: 
Before him all the nations are as nought,
    as nothing and void he counts them.

    18: 
To whom can you liken God?
    With what likeness can you confront him?

    19: 
An idol? An artisan casts it,
    the smith plates it with gold,
    fits it with silver chains.

    20: 
Is mulberry wood the offering?
    A skilled artisan picks out
    a wood that will not rot,
    Seeks to set up for himself
    an idol that will not totter.

    21: 
Do you not know? Have you not heard?
    Was it not told you from the beginning?
    Have you not understood from the founding of the earth?

    22: 
The one who is enthroned above the vault of the earth,
    its inhabitants like grasshoppers,
Who stretches out the heavens like a veil
    and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in,

    23: 
Who brings princes to nought
    and makes the rulers of the earth as nothing.

    24: 
Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown,
    scarcely their stem rooted in the earth,
When he breathes upon them and they wither,
    and the stormwind carries them away like straw.

    25: 
To whom can you liken me as an equal?
    says the Holy One.

    26: 
Lift up your eyes on high
    and see who created these:
He leads out their army and numbers them,
    calling them all by name.
By his great might and the strength of his power
    not one of them is missing!

    27: 
Why, O Jacob, do you say,
    and declare, O Israel,
“My way is hidden from the Lord,
    and my right is disregarded by my God”?

    28: 
Do you not know?
    Have you not heard?
The Lord is God from of old,
    creator of the ends of the earth.
He does not faint or grow weary,
    and his knowledge is beyond scrutiny.

    29: 
He gives power to the faint,
    abundant strength to the weak.

    30: 
Though young men faint and grow weary,
    and youths stagger and fall,

    31: 
They that hope in the Lord will renew their strength,
    they will soar on eagles’ wings;
They will run and not grow weary,
    walk and not grow faint.
