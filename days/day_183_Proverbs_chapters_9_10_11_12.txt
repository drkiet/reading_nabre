    from the heights out over the city:

    4: 
“Let whoever is naive turn in here;
    to any who lack sense I say,

    5: 
Come, eat of my food,
    and drink of the wine I have mixed!

    6: 
Forsake foolishness that you may live;
    advance in the way of understanding.”

“Let those who are naive turn in here,
    to those who lack sense I say,

    17: 
Stolen water is sweet,
    and bread taken secretly is pleasing!”

Little do they know that the shades are there,
    that her guests are in the depths of Sheol!
