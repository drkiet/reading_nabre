Day 219:

Reading Isaiah, chapters ['29', '30', '31', '32']:

  Chapter 29.

    1: 
    2: 
Judgment and Deliverance of Jerusalem
1 
Ah! Ariel, Ariel,
    city where David encamped!
Let year follow year,
    and feast follow feast,
2 
But I will bring distress upon Ariel,
    and there will be mourning and moaning.
You shall be to me like Ariel:

    3: 
    I will encamp like David against you;
I will circle you with outposts
    and set up siege works against you.

    4: 
You shall speak from beneath the earth,
    and from the dust below, your words shall come.
Your voice shall be that of a ghost from the earth,
    and your words shall whisper from the dust.

    5: 
The horde of your arrogant shall be like fine dust,
    a horde of tyrants like flying chaff.
Then suddenly, in an instant,

    6: 
    you shall be visited by the Lord of hosts,
With thunder, earthquake, and great noise,
    whirlwind, storm, and the flame of consuming fire.

    7: 
Then like a dream,
    a vision of the night,
Shall be the horde of all the nations
    who make war against Ariel:
All the outposts, the siege works against it,
    all who distress it.

    8: 
    9: udgment and Deliverance of Jerusalem
1 
Ah! Ariel, Ariel,
    city where David encamped!
Let year follow year,
    and feast follow feast,
2 
But I will bring distress upon Ariel,
    and there will be mourning and moaning.
You shall be to me like Ariel:
3 
    I will encamp like David against you;
I will circle you with outposts
    and set up siege works against you.
4 
You shall speak from beneath the earth,
    and from the dust below, your words shall come.
Your voice shall be that of a ghost from the earth,
    and your words shall whisper from the dust.
5 
The horde of your arrogant shall be like fine dust,
    a horde of tyrants like flying chaff.
Then suddenly, in an instant,
6 
    you shall be visited by the Lord of hosts,
With thunder, earthquake, and great noise,
    whirlwind, storm, and the flame of consuming fire.
7 
[b]Then like a dream,
    a vision of the night,
Shall be the horde of all the nations
    who make war against Ariel:
All the outposts, the siege works against it,
    all who distress it.
8 
As when a hungry man dreams he is eating
    and awakens with an empty stomach,
Or when a thirsty man dreams he is drinking
    and awakens faint, his throat parched,
So shall the horde of all the nations be,
    who make war against Mount Zion.
Blindness and Perversity
9 
[c]Stupefy yourselves and stay stupid;
    blind yourselves and stay blind!
You who are drunk, but not from wine,
    who stagger, but not from strong drink!

    10: 
For the Lord has poured out on you
    a spirit of deep sleep.
He has shut your eyes (the prophets)
    and covered your heads (the seers).

    11: For you the vision of all this has become like the words of a sealed scroll. When it is handed to one who can read, with the request, “Read this,” the reply is, “I cannot, because it is sealed.” 
    12: When the scroll is handed to one who cannot read, with the request, “Read this,” the reply is, “I cannot read.”

    13: 
    The Lord said:
Since this people draws near with words only
    and honors me with their lips alone,
    though their hearts are far from me,
And fear of me has become
    mere precept of human teaching,

    14: 
Therefore I will again deal with this people
    in surprising and wondrous fashion:
The wisdom of the wise shall perish,
    the prudence of the prudent shall vanish.

    15: 
Ah! You who would hide a plan
    too deep for the Lord!
Who work in the dark, saying,
    “Who sees us, who knows us?”

    16: 
Your perversity is as though the potter
    were taken to be the clay:
As though what is made should say of its maker,
    “He did not make me!”
Or the vessel should say of the potter,
    “He does not understand.”
Redemption

    17: 
Surely, in a very little while,
    Lebanon shall be changed into an orchard,
    and the orchard be considered a forest!

    18: 
On that day the deaf shall hear
    the words of a scroll;
And out of gloom and darkness,
    the eyes of the blind shall see.

    19: 
The lowly shall again find joy in the Lord,
    the poorest rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

    20: 
For the tyrant shall be no more,
    the scoffer shall cease to be;
All who are ready for evil shall be cut off,

    21: 
    those who condemn with a mere word,
Who ensnare the defender at the gate,
    and leave the just with an empty claim.

    22: 
Therefore thus says the Lord,
    the God of the house of Jacob,
    who redeemed Abraham:
No longer shall Jacob be ashamed,
    no longer shall his face grow pale.

    23: 
For when his children see
    the work of my hands in his midst,
They shall sanctify my name;
    they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,
    be in awe of the God of Israel.

    24: 
Those who err in spirit shall acquire understanding,
    those who find fault shall receive instruction.


  Chapter 30.

    1: 
Ah! Rebellious children,
    oracle of the Lord,
Who carry out a plan that is not mine,
    who make an alliance I did not inspire,
    thus adding sin upon sin;

    2: 
    3: 
Oracle on the Futility of an Alliance with Egypt
1 
Ah! Rebellious children,
    oracle of the Lord,
Who carry out a plan that is not mine,
    who make an alliance[b] I did not inspire,
    thus adding sin upon sin;
2 
They go down to Egypt,
    without asking my counsel,[c]
To seek strength in Pharaoh’s protection
    and take refuge in Egypt’s shadow.
3 
Pharaoh’s protection shall become your shame,
    refuge in Egypt’s shadow your disgrace.

    4: 
When his princes are at Zoan
    and his messengers reach Hanes,

    5: 
All shall be ashamed
    of a people that gain them nothing,
Neither help nor benefit,
    but only shame and reproach.

    6: 
    Oracle on the Beasts of the Negeb.
Through the distressed and troubled land
    of the lioness and roaring lion,
    of the viper and flying saraph,
They carry their riches on the backs of donkeys
    and their treasures on the humps of camels
To a people good for nothing,

    7: 
    to Egypt whose help is futile and vain.
Therefore I call her
    “Rahab Sit-still.”

    8: 
Now come, write it on a tablet they can keep,
    inscribe it on a scroll;
That in time to come it may be
    an eternal witness.

    9: For this is a rebellious people,
    deceitful children,
Children who refuse
    to listen to the instruction of the Lord;

    10: 
Who say to the seers, “Do not see”;
    to the prophets, “Do not prophesy truth for us;
    speak smooth things to us, see visions that deceive!

    11: 
Turn aside from the way! Get out of the path!
    Let us hear no more
    of the Holy One of Israel!”

    12: 
Therefore, thus says the Holy One of Israel:
    Because you reject this word,
And put your trust in oppression and deceit,
    and depend on them,

    13: 
This iniquity of yours shall be
    like a descending rift
Bulging out in a high wall
    whose crash comes suddenly, in an instant,

    14: 
Crashing like a potter’s jar
    smashed beyond rescue,
And among its fragments cannot be found
    a sherd to scoop fire from the hearth
    or dip water from the cistern.

    15: 
For thus said the Lord God,
    the Holy One of Israel:
By waiting and by calm you shall be saved,
    in quiet and in trust shall be your strength.
    But this you did not will.

    16: 
“No,” you said,
    “Upon horses we will flee.”
    Very well, you shall flee!
“Upon swift steeds we will ride.”
    Very well, swift shall be your pursuers!

    17: 
A thousand shall tremble at the threat of one—
    if five threaten, you shall flee.
You will then be left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop,
    like a flag on a hill.
Zion’s Future Deliverance

    18: 
Truly, the Lord is waiting to be gracious to you,
    truly, he shall rise to show you mercy;
For the Lord is a God of justice:
    happy are all who wait for him!

    19: 
Yes, people of Zion, dwelling in Jerusalem,
    you shall no longer weep;
He will be most gracious to you when you cry out;
    as soon as he hears he will answer you.

    20: 
The Lord will give you bread in adversity
    and water in affliction.
No longer will your Teacher hide himself,
    but with your own eyes you shall see your Teacher,

    21: 
And your ears shall hear a word behind you:
    “This is the way; walk in it,”
    when you would turn to the right or the left.

    22: 
You shall defile your silver-plated idols
    and your gold-covered images;
You shall throw them away like filthy rags,
    you shall say, “Get out!”

    23: 
He will give rain for the seed
    you sow in the ground,
And the bread that the soil produces
    will be rich and abundant.
On that day your cattle will graze
    in broad meadows;

    24: 
The oxen and the donkeys that till the ground
    will eat silage tossed to them
    with shovel and pitchfork.

    25: 
Upon every high mountain and lofty hill
    there will be streams of running water.
On the day of the great slaughter,
    when the towers fall,

    26: 
The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun,
    and the light of the sun will be seven times greater,
    like the light of seven days,
On the day the Lord binds up the wounds of his people
    and heals the bruises left by his blows.
Divine Judgment on Assyria

    27: 
See, the name of the Lord is coming from afar,
    burning with anger, heavy with threat,
His lips filled with fury,
    tongue like a consuming fire,

    28: 
Breath like an overflowing torrent
    that reaches up to the neck!
He will winnow the nations with a destructive winnowing
    and bridle the jaws of the peoples to send them astray.

    29: 
    30: Oracle on the Futility of an Alliance with Egypt
1 
Ah! Rebellious children,
    oracle of the Lord,
Who carry out a plan that is not mine,
    who make an alliance[b] I did not inspire,
    thus adding sin upon sin;
2 
They go down to Egypt,
    without asking my counsel,[c]
To seek strength in Pharaoh’s protection
    and take refuge in Egypt’s shadow.
3 
Pharaoh’s protection shall become your shame,
    refuge in Egypt’s shadow your disgrace.
4 
When his princes are at Zoan
    and his messengers reach Hanes,
5 
All shall be ashamed
    of a people that gain them nothing,
Neither help nor benefit,
    but only shame and reproach.
6 
    Oracle on the Beasts of the Negeb.
Through the distressed and troubled land[d]
    of the lioness and roaring lion,
    of the viper and flying saraph,
They carry their riches on the backs of donkeys
    and their treasures on the humps of camels
To a people good for nothing,
7 
    to Egypt whose help is futile and vain.
Therefore I call her
    “Rahab[e] Sit-still.”
8 
[f]Now come, write it on a tablet they can keep,
    inscribe it on a scroll;
That in time to come it may be
    an eternal witness.
9 
For this is a rebellious people,
    deceitful children,
Children who refuse
    to listen to the instruction of the Lord;
10 
Who say to the seers, “Do not see”;
    to the prophets,[g] “Do not prophesy truth for us;
    speak smooth things to us, see visions that deceive!
11 
Turn aside from the way! Get out of the path!
    Let us hear no more
    of the Holy One of Israel!”
12 
Therefore, thus says the Holy One of Israel:
    Because you reject this word,
And put your trust in oppression and deceit,
    and depend on them,
13 
This iniquity of yours shall be
    like a descending rift
Bulging out in a high wall
    whose crash comes suddenly, in an instant,
14 
Crashing like a potter’s jar
    smashed beyond rescue,
And among its fragments cannot be found
    a sherd to scoop fire from the hearth
    or dip water from the cistern.
15 
For thus said the Lord God,
    the Holy One of Israel:
By waiting and by calm you shall be saved,
    in quiet and in trust shall be your strength.
    But this you did not will.
16 
“No,” you said,
    “Upon horses we will flee.”
    Very well, you shall flee!
“Upon swift steeds we will ride.”
    Very well, swift shall be your pursuers!
17 
A thousand shall tremble at the threat of one—
    if five threaten, you shall flee.
You will then be left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop,
    like a flag on a hill.
Zion’s Future Deliverance
18 
Truly, the Lord is waiting to be gracious to you,
    truly, he shall rise to show you mercy;
For the Lord is a God of justice:
    happy are all who wait for him!
19 
Yes, people of Zion, dwelling in Jerusalem,
    you shall no longer weep;
He will be most gracious to you when you cry out;
    as soon as he hears he will answer you.
20 
The Lord will give you bread in adversity
    and water in affliction.
No longer will your Teacher[h] hide himself,
    but with your own eyes you shall see your Teacher,
21 
And your ears shall hear a word behind you:
    “This is the way; walk in it,”
    when you would turn to the right or the left.
22 
You shall defile your silver-plated idols
    and your gold-covered images;
You shall throw them away like filthy rags,
    you shall say, “Get out!”
23 
He will give rain for the seed
    you sow in the ground,
And the bread that the soil produces
    will be rich and abundant.
On that day your cattle will graze
    in broad meadows;
24 
The oxen and the donkeys that till the ground
    will eat silage tossed to them
    with shovel and pitchfork.
25 
Upon every high mountain and lofty hill
    there will be streams of running water.
On the day of the great slaughter,
    when the towers fall,
26 
The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun,
    and the light of the sun will be seven times greater,
    like the light of seven days,
On the day the Lord binds up the wounds of his people
    and heals the bruises left by his blows.
Divine Judgment on Assyria[i]
27 
See, the name of the Lord is coming from afar,
    burning with anger, heavy with threat,
His lips filled with fury,
    tongue like a consuming fire,
28 
Breath like an overflowing torrent
    that reaches up to the neck!
He will winnow the nations with a destructive winnowing
    and bridle the jaws of the peoples to send them astray.
29 
For you, there will be singing
    as on a night when a feast is observed,
And joy of heart
    as when one marches along with a flute
Going to the mountain of the Lord,
    to the Rock of Israel.
30 
The Lord will make his glorious voice heard,
    and reveal his arm coming down
In raging fury and flame of consuming fire,
    in tempest, and rainstorm, and hail.

    31: 
For at the voice of the Lord, Assyria will be shattered,
    as he strikes with the rod;

    32: 
And every sweep of the rod of his punishment,
    which the Lord will bring down on him,
Will be accompanied by timbrels and lyres,
    while he wages war against him.

    33: 
For his tophet has long been ready,
    truly it is prepared for the king;
His firepit made both deep and wide,
    with fire and firewood in abundance,
And the breath of the Lord, like a stream of sulfur,
    setting it afire.


  Chapter 31.

    1: Against the Egyptian Alliance
1 
Ah! Those who go down to Egypt for help,
    who rely on horses;
Who put their trust in chariots because of their number,
    and in horsemen because of their combined power,
But look not to the Holy One of Israel
    nor seek the Lord!

    2: 
    3: 
Against the Egyptian Alliance
1 
Ah! Those who go down to Egypt for help,
    who rely on horses;
Who put their trust in chariots because of their number,
    and in horsemen because of their combined power,
But look not to the Holy One of Israel
    nor seek the Lord!
2 
Yet he too is wise and will bring disaster;
    he will not turn from his threats.
He will rise up against the house of the wicked
    and against those who help evildoers.
3 
The Egyptians are human beings, not God,
    their horses flesh, not spirit;
When the Lord stretches forth his hand,
    the helper shall stumble, the one helped shall fall,
    and both of them shall perish together.

    4: 
    For thus says the Lord to me:
As a lion or its young
    growling over the prey,
With a band of shepherds
    assembled against it,
Is neither dismayed by their shouts
    nor cowed by their noise,
So shall the Lord of hosts come down
    to wage war upon Mount Zion, upon its height.

    5: 
Like hovering birds, so the Lord of hosts
    shall shield Jerusalem,
To shield and deliver,
    to spare and rescue.

    6: Return, O Israelites, to him whom you have utterly deserted. 
    7: On that day each one of you shall reject his idols of silver and gold, which your hands have made.

    8: 
Assyria shall fall by a sword, not wielded by human being,
    no mortal sword shall devour him;
He shall flee before the sword,
    and his young men shall be impressed as laborers.

    9: He shall rush past his crag in panic,
    and his princes desert the standard in terror,
Says the Lord who has a fire in Zion
    and a furnace in Jerusalem.


  Chapter 32.

    1: 
    2: 
    3: 
The Kingdom of Justice
1 
See, a king will reign justly
    and princes will rule rightly.
2 
Each of them will be like a shelter from the wind,
    a refuge from the rain.
They will be like streams of water in a dry country,
    like the shade of a great rock in a parched land.
3 
The eyes of those who see will not be closed;
    the ears of those who hear will be attentive.

    4: 
The hasty of heart shall take thought to know,
    and tongues of stutterers shall speak readily and clearly.

    5: 
No more will the fool be called noble,
    nor the deceiver be considered honorable.

    6: 
For the fool speaks folly,
    his heart plans evil:
Godless actions,
    perverse speech against the Lord,
Letting the hungry go empty
    and the thirsty without drink.

    7: 
The deceits of the deceiver are evil,
    he plans devious schemes:
To ruin the poor with lies,
    and the needy when they plead their case.

    8: 
But the noble plan noble deeds,
    and in noble deeds they persist.
The Women of Jerusalem

    9: You women so complacent, rise up and hear my voice,
    daughters so confident, give heed to my words.

    10: 
In a little more than a year
    your confidence will be shaken;
For the vintage will fail,
    no fruit harvest will come in.

    11: 
Tremble, you who are so complacent!
    Shudder, you who are so confident!
Strip yourselves bare,
    with only a loincloth for cover.

    12: 
Beat your breasts
    for the pleasant fields,
    for the fruitful vine;

    13: 
For the soil of my people,
    overgrown with thorns and briers;
For all the joyful houses,
    the exultant city.

    14: 
The castle will be forsaken,
    the noisy city deserted;
Citadel and tower will become wasteland forever,
    the joy of wild donkeys, the pasture of flocks;

    15: 
Until the spirit from on high
    is poured out on us.
And the wilderness becomes a garden land
    and the garden land seems as common as forest.

    16: 
Then judgment will dwell in the wilderness
    and justice abide in the garden land.

    17: 
The work of justice will be peace;
    the effect of justice, calm and security forever.

    18: 
My people will live in peaceful country,
    in secure dwellings and quiet resting places.

    19: 
And the forest will come down completely,
    the city will be utterly laid low.

    20: 
Happy are you who sow beside every stream,
    and let the ox and the donkey go freely!


End of day 219.
