Day 139:

Reading Job, chapters ['29', '30', '31', '32']:

  Chapter 29.

    1: 
    2: 
1 Job took up his theme again and said:
2 
Oh, that I were as in the months past,
    as in the days when God watched over me:

    3: 
While he kept his lamp shining above my head,
    and by his light I walked through darkness;

    4: 
As I was in my flourishing days,
    when God sheltered my tent;

    5: 
When the Almighty was still with me,
    and my children were round about me;

    6: 
When my footsteps were bathed in cream,
    and the rock flowed with streams of oil.

    7: 
Whenever I went out to the gate of the city
    and took my seat in the square,

    8: 
    9:  Job took up his theme again and said:
2 
Oh, that I were as in the months past,
    as in the days when God watched over me:
3 
While he kept his lamp shining above my head,
    and by his light I walked through darkness;
4 
As I was in my flourishing days,
    when God sheltered my tent;
5 
When the Almighty was still with me,
    and my children were round about me;
6 
When my footsteps were bathed in cream,
    and the rock flowed with streams of oil.[b]
7 
Whenever I went out to the gate of the city
    and took my seat in the square,
8 
The young men saw me and withdrew,
    and the elders rose up and stood;
9 
Officials refrained from speaking
    and covered their mouths with their hands;

    10: 
The voice of the princes was silenced,
    and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths.

    11: 
The ear that heard blessed me;
    the eye that saw acclaimed me.

    12: 
For I rescued the poor who cried out for help,
    the orphans, and the unassisted;

    13: 
The blessing of those in extremity came upon me,
    and the heart of the widow I made joyful.

    14: 
I wore my righteousness like a garment;
    justice was my robe and my turban.

    15: 
I was eyes to the blind,
    and feet to the lame was I.

    16: 
I was a father to the poor;
    the complaint of the stranger I pursued,

    17: 
And I broke the jaws of the wicked man;
    from his teeth I forced the prey.

    18: 
I said: “In my own nest I shall grow old;
    I shall multiply years like the phoenix.

    19: 
My root is spread out to the waters;
    the dew rests by night on my branches.

    20: 
My glory is fresh within me,
    and my bow is renewed in my hand!”

    21: 
For me they listened and waited;
    they were silent for my counsel.

    22: 
Once I spoke, they said no more,
    but received my pronouncement drop by drop.

    23: 
They waited for me as for the rain;
    they drank in my words like the spring rains.

    24: 
When I smiled on them they could not believe it;
    they would not let the light of my face be dimmed.

    25: 
I decided their course and sat at their head,
    I lived like a king among the troops,
    like one who comforts mourners.


  Chapter 30.

    1: 
But now they hold me in derision
    who are younger than I,
Whose fathers I should have disdained
    to rank with the dogs of my flock.

    2: 
    3: 
1 
But now they hold me in derision
    who are younger than I,
Whose fathers I should have disdained
    to rank with the dogs of my flock.
2 
Such strength as they had meant nothing to me;
    their vigor had perished.
3 
In want and emaciating hunger
    they fled to the parched lands:
    to the desolate wasteland by night.

    4: 
They plucked saltwort and shrubs;
    the roots of the broom plant were their food.

    5: 
They were banished from the community,
    with an outcry like that against a thief—

    6: 
To dwell on the slopes of the wadies,
    in caves of sand and stone;

    7: 
Among the bushes they brayed;
    under the nettles they huddled together.

    8: 
Irresponsible, of no account,
    they were driven out of the land.

    9: Yet now they sing of me in mockery;
    I have become a byword among them.

    10: 
They abhor me, they stand aloof,
    they do not hesitate to spit in my face!

    11: 
Because he has loosened my bowstring and afflicted me,
    they have thrown off restraint in my presence.

    12: 
On my right the young rabble rise up;
    they trip my feet,
    they build their approaches for my ruin.

    13: 
They tear up my path,
    they promote my ruin,
    no helper is there against them.

    14: 
As through a wide breach they advance;
    amid the uproar they come on in waves;

    15: 
    terrors roll over me.
My dignity is driven off like the wind,
    and my well-being vanishes like a cloud.

    16: 
And now my life ebbs away from me,
    days of affliction have taken hold of me.

    17: 
At night he pierces my bones,
    my sinews have no rest.

    18: 
With great difficulty I change my clothes,
    the collar of my tunic fits around my waist.

    19: 
He has cast me into the mire;
    I have become like dust and ashes.

    20: 
I cry to you, but you do not answer me;
    I stand, but you take no notice.

    21: 
You have turned into my tormentor,
    and with your strong hand you attack me.

    22: 
You raise me up and drive me before the wind;
    I am tossed about by the tempest.

    23: 
Indeed I know that you will return me to death
    to the house destined for everyone alive.

    24: 
Yet should not a hand be held out
    to help a wretched person in distress?

    25: 
Did I not weep for the hardships of others;
    was not my soul grieved for the poor?

    26: 
Yet when I looked for good, evil came;
    when I expected light, darkness came.

    27: 
My inward parts seethe and will not be stilled;
    days of affliction have overtaken me.

    28: 
I go about in gloom, without the sun;
    I rise in the assembly and cry for help.

    29: 
    30: 1 
But now they hold me in derision
    who are younger than I,
Whose fathers I should have disdained
    to rank with the dogs of my flock.
2 
Such strength as they had meant nothing to me;
    their vigor had perished.
3 
In want and emaciating hunger
    they fled to the parched lands:
    to the desolate wasteland by night.

    I have become a byword among them.
10 
They abhor me, they stand aloof,
    they do not hesitate to spit in my face!
11 
[b]Because he has loosened my bowstring and afflicted me,
    they have thrown off restraint in my presence.
12 
On my right the young rabble rise up;
    they trip my feet,
    they build their approaches for my ruin.

    no helper is there against them.

    and my well-being vanishes like a cloud.
16 
And now my life ebbs away from me,
    days of affliction have taken hold of me.
17 
[c]At night he pierces my bones,
    my sinews have no rest.
18 
With great difficulty I change my clothes,
    the collar of my tunic fits around my waist.
19 
He has cast me into the mire;
    I have become like dust and ashes.
20 
I cry to you, but you do not answer me;
    I stand, but you take no notice.
21

    when I expected light, darkness came.
27 
My inward parts seethe and will not be stilled;
    days of affliction have overtaken me.
28 
I go about in gloom, without the sun;
    I rise in the assembly and cry for help.
29 
I have become a brother to jackals,
    a companion to ostriches.
30 
My blackened skin falls away from me;
    my very frame is scorched by the heat.

    31: 
My lyre is tuned to mourning,
    and my reed pipe to sounds of weeping.


  Chapter 31.

    1: 1 
I made a covenant with my eyes
    not to gaze upon a virgin.

    2: 
    3: 
1 
I made a covenant with my eyes
    not to gaze upon a virgin.
2 
What portion comes from God above,
    what heritage from the Almighty on high?
3 
Is it not calamity for the unrighteous,
    and woe for evildoers?

    4: 
Does he not see my ways,
    and number all my steps?

    5: 
If I have walked in falsehood
    and my foot has hastened to deceit,

    6: 
Let God weigh me in the scales of justice;
    thus will he know my innocence!

    7: 
If my steps have turned out of the way,
    and my heart has followed my eyes,
    or any stain clings to my hands,

    8: 
Then may I sow, but another eat,
    and may my produce be rooted up!

    9: If my heart has been enticed toward a woman,
    and I have lain in wait at my neighbor’s door;

    10: 
Then may my wife grind for another,
    and may others kneel over her!

    11: 
For that would be heinous,
    a crime to be condemned,

    12: 
A fire that would consume down to Abaddon
    till it uprooted all my crops.

    13: 
Had I refused justice to my manservant
    or to my maidservant, when they had a complaint against me,

    14: 
What then should I do when God rises up?
    What could I answer when he demands an account?

    15: 
Did not he who made me in the belly make him?
    Did not the same One fashion us in the womb?

    16: 
If I have denied anything that the poor desired,
    or allowed the eyes of the widow to languish

    17: 
While I ate my portion alone,
    with no share in it for the fatherless,

    18: 
Though like a father he has reared me from my youth,
    guiding me even from my mother’s womb—

    19: 
If I have seen a wanderer without clothing,
    or a poor man without covering,

    20: 
Whose limbs have not blessed me
    when warmed with the fleece of my sheep;

    21: 
If I have raised my hand against the innocent
    because I saw that I had supporters at the gate—

    22: 
Then may my arm fall from the shoulder,
    my forearm be broken at the elbow!

    23: 
For I dread calamity from God,
    and his majesty will overpower me.

    24: 
Had I put my trust in gold
    or called fine gold my security;

    25: 
Or had I rejoiced that my wealth was great,
    or that my hand had acquired abundance—

    26: 
Had I looked upon the light as it shone,
    or the moon in the splendor of its progress,

    27: 
And had my heart been secretly enticed
    to blow them a kiss with my hand,

    28: 
This too would be a crime for condemnation,
    for I should have denied God above.

    29: 
Had I rejoiced at the destruction of my enemy
    or exulted when evil came upon him,

    30: 
    31: 1 
I made a covenant with my eyes
    not to gaze upon a virgin.
2 
What portion comes from God above,
    what heritage from the Almighty on high?
3 
Is it not calamity for the unrighteous,
    and woe for evildoers?
4 
Does he not see my ways,
    and number all my steps?
5 
If I have walked in falsehood
    and my foot has hastened to deceit,
6 
Let God weigh me in the scales of justice;
    thus will he know my innocence!
7 
If my steps have turned out of the way,
    and my heart has followed my eyes,
    or any stain clings to my hands,
8 
Then may I sow, but another eat,
    and may my produce be rooted up!
9 
If my heart has been enticed toward a woman,
    and I have lain in wait at my neighbor’s door;
10 
Then may my wife grind for another,
    and may others kneel over her!
11 
For that would be heinous,
    a crime to be condemned,
12 
A fire that would consume down to Abaddon[b]
    till it uprooted all my crops.
13 
Had I refused justice to my manservant
    or to my maidservant, when they had a complaint against me,
14 
What then should I do when God rises up?
    What could I answer when he demands an account?
15 
Did not he who made me in the belly make him?
    Did not the same One fashion us in the womb?
16 
If I have denied anything that the poor desired,
    or allowed the eyes of the widow to languish
17 
While I ate my portion alone,
    with no share in it for the fatherless,
18 
Though like a father he[c] has reared me from my youth,
    guiding me even from my mother’s womb—
19 
If I have seen a wanderer without clothing,
    or a poor man without covering,
20 
Whose limbs have not blessed me
    when warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
21 
If I have raised my hand against the innocent
    because I saw that I had supporters at the gate—[d]
22 
Then may my arm fall from the shoulder,
    my forearm be broken at the elbow!
23 
For I dread calamity from God,
    and his majesty will overpower me.
24 
Had I put my trust in gold
    or called fine gold my security;
25 
Or had I rejoiced that my wealth was great,
    or that my hand had acquired abundance—
26 
Had I looked upon the light[e] as it shone,
    or the moon in the splendor of its progress,
27 
And had my heart been secretly enticed
    to blow them a kiss with my hand,
28 
This too would be a crime for condemnation,
    for I should have denied God above.
29 
Had I rejoiced at the destruction of my enemy
    or exulted when evil came upon him,
30 
Even though I had not allowed my mouth to sin
    by invoking a curse against his life—
31 
Had not the men of my tent exclaimed,
    “Who has not been filled with his meat!”[f]

    32: 
No stranger lodged in the street,
    for I opened my door to wayfarers—

    33: 
Had I, all too human, hidden my sins
    and buried my guilt in my bosom

    34: 
Because I feared the great multitude
    and the scorn of the clans terrified me—
    then I should have remained silent, and not come out of doors!

    35: 
Oh, that I had one to hear my case:
    here is my signature:[i] let the Almighty answer me!
Let my accuser write out his indictment!

    36: 
Surely, I should wear it on my shoulder
    or put it on me like a diadem;

    37: 
Of all my steps I should give him an account;
    like a prince I should present myself before him.

    38: 
If my land has cried out against me
    till its furrows wept together;

    39: 
If I have eaten its strength without payment
    and grieved the hearts of its tenants;

    40: 
Then let the thorns grow instead of wheat
    and stinkweed instead of barley!
The words of Job are ended.


  Chapter 32.

    1: 
    2: 
    3: 
1 Then the three men ceased to answer Job, because in his own eyes he was in the right. 2 But the anger of Elihu, son of Barachel the Buzite, of the clan of Ram, was kindled. He was angry with Job for considering himself rather than God to be in the right. 3 He was angry also with the three friends because they had not found a good answer and had not condemned Job. 
    4: But since these men were older than he, Elihu bided his time before addressing Job. 
    5: When, however, Elihu saw that there was no reply in the mouths of the three men, his wrath was inflamed. 
    6: So Elihu, son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said:
I am young and you are very old;
    therefore I held back and was afraid
    to declare to you my knowledge.

    7: 
I thought, days should speak,
    and many years teach wisdom!

    8: 
But there is a spirit in human beings,
    the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding.

    9: It is not those of many days who are wise,
    nor the aged who understand the right.

    10: 
Therefore I say, listen to me;
    I also will declare my knowledge!

    11: 
Behold, I have waited for your words,
    have given ear to your arguments,
    as you searched out what to say.

    12: 
Yes, I followed you attentively:
    And look, none of you has convicted Job,
    not one could refute his statements.

    13: 
So do not say, “We have met wisdom;
    God can vanquish him but no mortal!”

    14: 
For had he addressed his words to me,
    I would not then have answered him with your words.

    15: 
They are dismayed, they make no more reply;
    words fail them.

    16: 
Must I wait? Now that they speak no more,
    and have ceased to make reply,

    17: 
I too will speak my part;
    I also will declare my knowledge!

    18: 
For I am full of words;
    the spirit within me compels me.

    19: 
My belly is like unopened wine,
    like wineskins ready to burst.

    20: 
Let me speak and obtain relief;
    let me open my lips, and reply.

    21: 
I would not be partial to anyone,
    nor give flattering titles to any.

    22: 
For I know nothing of flattery;
    if I did, my Maker would soon take me away.
