Day 232:

Reading Jeremiah, chapters ['13', '14', '15', '16']:

  Chapter 13.

    1: 
Judah’s Corruption. 1 The Lord said to me: Go buy yourself a linen loincloth; wear it on your loins, but do not put it in water. 
    2: 
    3: Judah’s Corruption. 1 The Lord said to me: Go buy yourself a linen loincloth; wear it on your loins, but do not put it in water. 2 I bought the loincloth, as the Lord commanded, and put it on. 3 A second time the word of the Lord came to me thus: 
    4: Take the loincloth which you bought and are wearing, and go at once to the Perath; hide it there in a cleft of the rock. 
    5: Obedient to the Lord’s command, I went to the Perath and buried the loincloth. 
    6: After a long time, the Lord said to me: Go now to the Perath and fetch the loincloth which I told you to hide there. 
    7: So I went to the Perath, looked for the loincloth and took it from the place I had hidden it. But it was rotted, good for nothing! 
    8: Then the word came to me from the Lord: 
    9: hus says the Lord: So also I will allow the pride of Judah to rot, the great pride of Jerusalem. 
    10: This wicked people who refuse to obey my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and follow other gods, serving and worshiping them, will be like this loincloth, good for nothing. 
    11: For, as the loincloth clings to a man’s loins, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me—oracle of the Lord—to be my people, my fame, my praise, my glory. But they did not listen.
The Broken Wineflask. 
    12: 
    13: Judah’s Corruption. 1 The Lord said to me: Go buy yourself a linen loincloth; wear it on your loins, but do not put it in water. 2 I bought the loincloth, as the Lord commanded, and put it on. 3 A second time the word of the Lord came to me thus: 4 Take the loincloth which you bought and are wearing, and go at once to the Perath; hide it there in a cleft of the rock. 5 Obedient to the Lord’s command, I went to the Perath and buried the loincloth. 6 After a long time, the Lord said to me: Go now to the Perath and fetch the loincloth which I told you to hide there. 7 So I went to the Perath, looked for the loincloth and took it from the place I had hidden it. But it was rotted, good for nothing! 8 Then the word came to me from the Lord: 9 Thus says the Lord: So also I will allow the pride of Judah to rot, the great pride of Jerusalem. 10 This wicked people who refuse to obey my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and follow other gods, serving and worshiping them, will be like this loincloth, good for nothing. 11 For, as the loincloth clings to a man’s loins, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me—oracle of the Lord—to be my people, my fame, my praise, my glory. But they did not listen.
The Broken Wineflask. 12 Now speak to them this word: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Every wineflask should be filled with wine. If they reply, “Do we not know that every wineflask should be filled with wine?” 13 say to them: Thus says the Lord: Beware! I am making all the inhabitants of this land drunk, the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests and prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
    14: I will smash them against each other, parents and children together—oracle of the Lord—showing no compassion, I will neither spare nor pity, but I will destroy them.
A Last Warning

    15: 
Listen and give ear, do not be arrogant,
    for the Lord speaks.

    16: 
Give glory to the Lord, your God,
    before he brings darkness;
Before your feet stumble
    on mountains at twilight;
Before the light you look for turns to darkness,
    changes into black clouds.

    17: 
If you do not listen to this in your pride,
    I will weep many tears in secret;
My eyes will run with tears
    for the Lord’s flock, led away to exile.
Exile

    18: 
Say to the king and to the queen mother:
    come down from your throne;
From your heads
    your splendid crowns will fall.

    19: 
The cities of the Negeb are besieged,
    with no one to relieve them;
Judah is taken into exile—all of it—
    in total exile.
Jerusalem’s Disgrace

    20: 
Lift up your eyes and see
    those coming in from the north.
Where is the flock entrusted to you,
    your splendid sheep?

    21: 
What will you say when rulers are appointed over you,
    those you taught to be allies?
Will not pains seize you
    like those of a woman giving birth?

    22: 
If you say to yourself:
    “Why have these things happened to me?”
For your great guilt your skirts are stripped away
    and you are violated.

    23: 
Can Ethiopians change their skin,
    leopards their spots?
As easily would you be able to do good,
    accustomed to evil as you are.

    24: 
I will scatter them like chaff that flies
    on the desert wind.

    25: 
This is your lot, the portion I have measured out to you—
    oracle of the Lord.
Because you have forgotten me,
    and trusted in deception,

    26: 
I now will strip away your skirts,
    so that your shame is visible.

    27: 
Your adulteries, your neighings,
    your shameless prostitutions:
On the hills, in the fields
    I see your detestable crimes.
Woe to you, Jerusalem! How long will it be
    before you are clean?


  Chapter 14.

    1: 
The Great Drought. 1 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:

    2: 
Judah mourns,
    her gates are lifeless;
They are bowed to the ground,
    and the outcry of Jerusalem goes up.

    3: 
    4: The Great Drought. 1 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
2 
Judah mourns,
    her gates are lifeless;
They are bowed to the ground,
    and the outcry of Jerusalem goes up.
3 
The nobles send their servants for water,
    but when they come to the cisterns
They find no water
    and return with empty jars.
Confounded, despairing, they cover their heads
4 
    because of the ruined soil;
Because there is no rain in the land
    the farmers are confounded, they cover their heads.

    5: 
Even the doe in the field deserts her young
    because there is no grass.

    6: 
The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights,
    gasping for breath like jackals;
Their eyes grow dim;
    there is no grass.

    7: 
Even though our crimes bear witness against us,
    act, Lord, for your name’s sake—
Even though our rebellions are many,
    and we have sinned against you.

    8: 
Hope of Israel, Lord,
    our savior in time of need!
Why should you be a stranger in the land,
    like a traveler stopping only for a night?

    9: Why are you like someone bewildered,
    a champion who cannot save?
You are in our midst, Lord,
    your name we bear:
    do not forsake us!

    10: 
    Thus says the Lord about this people:
They so love to wander
    that they cannot restrain their feet.
The Lord takes no pleasure in them;
    now he remembers their guilt,
    and will punish their sins.

    11: Then the Lord said to me: Do not intercede for the well-being of this people. 
    12: If they fast, I will not listen to their supplication. If they sacrifice burnt offerings or grain offerings, I will take no pleasure in them. Rather, I will destroy them with the sword, famine, and plague.

    13: 
    14: The Great Drought. 1 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
2 
Judah mourns,
    her gates are lifeless;
They are bowed to the ground,
    and the outcry of Jerusalem goes up.
3 
The nobles send their servants for water,
    but when they come to the cisterns
They find no water
    and return with empty jars.
Confounded, despairing, they cover their heads
4 
    because of the ruined soil;
Because there is no rain in the land
    the farmers are confounded, they cover their heads.
5 
Even the doe in the field deserts her young
    because there is no grass.
6 
The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights,
    gasping for breath like jackals;
Their eyes grow dim;
    there is no grass.
7 
Even though our crimes bear witness against us,
    act, Lord, for your name’s sake—
Even though our rebellions are many,
    and we have sinned against you.
8 
Hope of Israel, Lord,
    our savior in time of need!
Why should you be a stranger in the land,
    like a traveler stopping only for a night?
9 
Why are you like someone bewildered,
    a champion who cannot save?
You are in our midst, Lord,
    your name we bear:
    do not forsake us!
10 
    Thus says the Lord about this people:
They so love to wander
    that they cannot restrain their feet.
The Lord takes no pleasure in them;
    now he remembers their guilt,
    and will punish their sins.
11 Then the Lord said to me: Do not intercede for the well-being of this people. 12 If they fast, I will not listen to their supplication. If they sacrifice burnt offerings or grain offerings, I will take no pleasure in them. Rather, I will destroy them with the sword, famine, and plague.
13 “Ah! Lord God,” I replied, “it is the prophets who say to them, ‘You shall not see the sword; famine shall not befall you. Indeed, I will give you lasting peace in this place.’”
14 These prophets utter lies in my name, the Lord said to me: I did not send them; I gave them no command, nor did I speak to them. They prophesy to you lying visions, foolish divination, deceptions from their own imagination. 
    15: Therefore, thus says the Lord: Concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, though I did not send them, and who say, “Sword and famine shall not befall this land”: by sword and famine shall these prophets meet their end. 
    16: The people to whom they prophesy shall be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of famine and the sword. No one shall bury them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters, for I will pour out upon them their own wickedness. 
    17: Speak to them this word:
Let my eyes stream with tears
    night and day, without rest,
Over the great destruction which overwhelms
    the virgin daughter of my people,
    over her incurable wound.

    18: 
If I walk out into the field,
    look! those slain by the sword;
If I enter the city,
    look! victims of famine.
Both prophet and priest ply their trade
    in a land they do not know.

    19: 
Have you really cast Judah off?
    Is Zion loathsome to you?
Why have you struck us a blow
    that cannot be healed?
We wait for peace, to no avail;
    for a time of healing, but terror comes instead.

    20: 
We recognize our wickedness, Lord,
    the guilt of our ancestors:
    we have sinned against you.

    21: 
Do not reject us, for your name’s sake,
    do not disgrace your glorious throne.
    Remember! Do not break your covenant with us.

    22: 
Among the idols of the nations are there any that give rain?
    Or can the mere heavens send showers?
Is it not you, Lord,
    our God, to whom we look?
    You alone do all these things.

  Chapter 15.

    1: 
1 The Lord said to me: Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me, my heart would not turn toward this people. Send them away from me and let them go. 
    2: If they ask you, “Where should we go?” tell them, Thus says the Lord: Whoever is marked for death, to death; whoever is marked for the sword, to the sword; whoever is marked for famine, to famine; whoever is marked for captivity, to captivity. 
    3: Four kinds of scourge I have decreed against them—oracle of the Lord—the sword to kill them; dogs to drag them off; the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy them. 
    4: 
    5: 1 The Lord said to me: Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me, my heart would not turn toward this people. Send them away from me and let them go. 2 If they ask you, “Where should we go?” tell them, Thus says the Lord: Whoever is marked for death, to death; whoever is marked for the sword, to the sword; whoever is marked for famine, to famine; whoever is marked for captivity, to captivity. 3 Four kinds of scourge I have decreed against them—oracle of the Lord—the sword to kill them; dogs to drag them off; the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy them. 4 And I will make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.
Scene of Tragedy
5 
Who will pity you, Jerusalem,
    who will grieve for you?
Who will stop to ask
    about your welfare?

    6: 
It is you who have disowned me—oracle of the Lord—
    turned your back upon me;
I stretched out my hand to destroy you,
    because I was weary of relenting.

    7: 
I winnowed them with a winnowing fork
    at the gates of the land;
I have bereaved, destroyed my people;
    they have not turned from their evil ways.

    8: 
Their widows were more numerous before me
    than the sands of the sea.
I brought against the mother of youths
    the destroyer at midday;
Suddenly I struck her
    with anguish and terror.

    9: The mother of seven faints away,
    breathing out her life;
Her sun sets in full day,
    she is ashamed, abashed.
Their survivors I will give to the sword
    in the presence of their enemies—oracle of the Lord.
Jeremiah’s Complaint

    10: 
Woe to me, my mother, that you gave me birth!
    a man of strife and contention to all the land!
I neither borrow nor lend,
    yet everyone curses me.

    11: 
Tell me, Lord, have I not served you for their good?
    Have I not interceded with you
    in time of misfortune and anguish?

    12: 
Can one break iron,
    iron from the north, and bronze?

    13: 
Your wealth and your treasures
    I give as plunder, demanding no payment,
    because of all your sins, throughout all your territory.

    14: 
    15: 1 The Lord said to me: Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me, my heart would not turn toward this people.

Jeremiah’s Complaint
10 
Woe to me, my mother, that you gave me birth!
    a man of strife and contention to all the land!
I neither borrow nor lend,
    yet everyone curses me.
11 
Tell me, Lord, have I not served you for their good?

13 
Your wealth and your treasures
    I give as plunder, demanding no payment,
    because of all your sins, throughout all your territory.
14 
And I shall enslave you to your enemies
    in a land you do not know,
For fire has broken out from my anger,
    it is kindled against you.
15 
    You know, Lord:
Remember me and take care of me,
    avenge me on my persecutors.
Because you are slow to anger, do not banish me;
    know that for you I have borne insult.

    16: 
When I found your words, I devoured them;
    your words were my joy, the happiness of my heart,
Because I bear your name,
    Lord, God of hosts.

    17: 
I did not sit celebrating
    in the circle of merrymakers;
Under the weight of your hand I sat alone
    because you filled me with rage.

    18: 
Why is my pain continuous,
    my wound incurable, refusing to be healed?
To me you are like a deceptive brook,
    waters that cannot be relied on!

    19: 
    Thus the Lord answered me:
If you come back and I take you back,
    in my presence you shall stand;
If you utter what is precious and not what is worthless,
    you shall be my mouth.
Then they will be the ones who turn to you,
    not you who turn to them.

    20: 
And I will make you toward this people
    a fortified wall of bronze.
Though they fight against you,
    they shall not prevail,
For I am with you,
    to save and rescue you—oracle of the Lord.

    21: 
I will rescue you from the hand of the wicked,
    and ransom you from the power of the violent.


  Chapter 16.

    1: 
Jeremiah’s Life a Warning. 1 This word came to me from the Lord: 
    2: Do not take a wife and do not have sons and daughters in this place, 
    3: for thus says the Lord concerning the sons and daughters born in this place, the mothers who give them birth, the fathers who beget them in this land: 
    4: Of deadly disease they shall die. Unlamented and unburied they will lie like dung on the ground. Sword and famine will make an end of them, and their corpses will become food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.

    5: 
    6: Jeremiah’s Life a Warning. 1 This word came to me from the Lord: 2 Do not take a wife and do not have sons and daughters in this place, 3 for thus says the Lord concerning the sons and daughters born in this place, the mothers who give them birth, the fathers who beget them in this land: 4 Of deadly disease they shall die. Unlamented and unburied they will lie like dung on the ground. Sword and famine will make an end of them, and their corpses will become food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.
5 Thus says the Lord: Do not go into a house of mourning; do not go there to lament or grieve for them. For I have withdrawn my peace from this people—oracle of the Lord—my love and my compassion. 6 They shall die, the great and the lowly, in this land, unburied and unlamented. No one will gash themselves or shave their heads for them. 
    7: They will not break bread with the bereaved to offer consolation for the dead; they will not give them the cup of consolation to drink over the death of father or mother.

    8: Do not enter a house of feasting to sit eating and drinking with them. 
    9: or thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Before your eyes and in your lifetime, I will silence in this place the song of joy and the song of gladness, the song of the bridegroom and the song of the bride.

    10: When you proclaim all these words to this people and they ask you: “Why has the Lord pronounced all this great disaster against us? What is our crime? What sin have we committed against the Lord, our God?”— 
    11: you shall answer them: It is because your ancestors have forsaken me—oracle of the Lord—and followed other gods that they served and worshiped; but me they have forsaken, and my law they did not keep. 
    12: And you have done worse than your ancestors. Here you are, every one of you, walking in the stubbornness of your evil heart instead of listening to me. 
    13: I will throw you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your ancestors have known; there you can serve other gods day and night because I will not show you mercy.
Return from Exile. 
    14: Therefore, days are coming—oracle of the Lord—when it will no longer be said, “As the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites out of Egypt”; 
    15: 
    16: Jeremiah’s Life a Warning. 1 This word came to me from the Lord: 2 Do not take a wife and do not have sons and daughters in this place, 3 for thus says the Lord concerning the sons and daughters born in this place, the mothers who give them birth, the fathers who beget them in this land: 4 Of deadly disease they shall die. Unlamented and unburied they will lie like dung on the ground. Sword and famine will make an end of them, and their corpses will become food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.
5 Thus says the Lord: Do not go into a house of mourning; do not go there to lament or grieve for them. For I have withdrawn my peace from this people—oracle of the Lord—my love and my compassion. 6 They shall die, the great and the lowly, in this land, unburied and unlamented. No one will gash themselves or shave their heads for them. 7 They will not break bread with the bereaved to offer consolation for the dead; they will not give them the cup of consolation to drink over the death of father or mother.
8 Do not enter a house of feasting to sit eating and drinking with them. 9 For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Before your eyes and in your lifetime, I will silence in this place the song of joy and the song of gladness, the song of the bridegroom and the song of the bride.
10 When you proclaim all these words to this people and they ask you: “Why has the Lord pronounced all this great disaster against us? What is our crime? What sin have we committed against the Lord, our God?”— 11 you shall answer them: It is because your ancestors have forsaken me—oracle of the Lord—and followed other gods that they served and worshiped; but me they have forsaken, and my law they did not keep. 12 And you have done worse than your ancestors. Here you are, every one of you, walking in the stubbornness of your evil heart instead of listening to me. 13 I will throw you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your ancestors have known; there you can serve other gods day and night because I will not show you mercy.
Return from Exile. 14 Therefore, days are coming—oracle of the Lord—when it will no longer be said, “As the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites out of Egypt”; 15 but rather, “As the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites out of the land of the north and out of all the countries to which he had banished them.” I will bring them back to the land I gave their ancestors.
Double Punishment. 16 Look!—oracle of the Lord—I will send many fishermen to catch them. After that, I will send many hunters to hunt them out from every mountain and hill and rocky crevice. 
    17: For my eyes are upon all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor does their guilt escape my sight. 
    18: I will at once repay them double for their crime and their sin because they profaned my land with the corpses of their detestable idols, and filled my heritage with their abominations.
Conversion of the Nations

    19: 
Lord, my strength, my fortress,
    my refuge in the day of distress!
To you nations will come
    from the ends of the earth, and say,
“Our ancestors inherited mere frauds,
    empty, worthless.”

    20: 
Can human beings make for themselves gods?
    But these are not gods at all!

    21: 
Therefore, I will indeed give them knowledge;
    this time I will make them acknowledge
My strength and my power:
    they shall know that my name is Lord.
