Reading Isaiah, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: 39
A. Indictment of Israel and Judah
Chapter 1
1 The vision which Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
Accusation and Appeal

    2: 
    3: 
A. Indictment of Israel and Judah
Chapter 1
1 The vision which Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
Accusation and Appeal
2 
[b]Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth,
    for the Lord speaks:
Sons have I raised and reared,
    but they have rebelled against me!
3 
An ox knows its owner,
    and an ass,[c] its master’s manger;
But Israel does not know,
    my people has not understood.

    4: 
Ah! Sinful nation, people laden with wickedness,
    evil offspring, corrupt children!
They have forsaken the Lord,
    spurned the Holy One of Israel,
    apostatized,

    5: 
Why would you yet be struck,
    that you continue to rebel?
The whole head is sick,
    the whole heart faint.

    6: 
From the sole of the foot to the head
    there is no sound spot in it;
Just bruise and welt and oozing wound,
    not drained, or bandaged,
    or eased with salve.

    7: 
Your country is waste,
    your cities burnt with fire;
Your land—before your eyes
    strangers devour it,
    a waste, like the devastation of Sodom.

    8: 
    9: . Indictment of Israel and Judah
Chapter 1
1 The vision which Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
Accusation and Appeal
2 
[b]Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth,
    for the Lord speaks:
Sons have I raised and reared,
    but they have rebelled against me!
3 
An ox knows its owner,
    and an ass,[c] its master’s manger;
But Israel does not know,
    my people has not understood.
4 
Ah![d] Sinful nation, people laden with wickedness,
    evil offspring, corrupt children!
They have forsaken the Lord,
    spurned the Holy One of Israel,
    apostatized,
5 
Why[e] would you yet be struck,
    that you continue to rebel?
The whole head is sick,
    the whole heart faint.
6 
From the sole of the foot to the head
    there is no sound spot in it;
Just bruise and welt and oozing wound,
    not drained, or bandaged,
    or eased with salve.
7 
Your country is waste,
    your cities burnt with fire;
Your land—before your eyes
    strangers devour it,
    a waste, like the devastation of Sodom.[f]
8 
And daughter Zion[g] is left
    like a hut in a vineyard,
Like a shed in a melon patch,
    like a city blockaded.
9 
If the Lord of hosts[h] had not
    left us a small remnant,
We would have become as Sodom,
    would have resembled Gomorrah.

    10: 
Hear the word of the Lord,
    princes of Sodom!
Listen to the instruction of our God,
    people of Gomorrah!

    11: 
What do I care for the multitude of your sacrifices?
    says the Lord.
I have had enough of whole-burnt rams
    and fat of fatlings;
In the blood of calves, lambs, and goats
    I find no pleasure.

    12: 
When you come to appear before me,
    who asks these things of you?

    13: 
Trample my courts no more!
    To bring offerings is useless;
    incense is an abomination to me.
New moon and sabbath, calling assemblies—
    festive convocations with wickedness—
    these I cannot bear.

    14: 
Your new moons and festivals I detest;
    they weigh me down, I tire of the load.

    15: 
When you spread out your hands,
    I will close my eyes to you;
Though you pray the more,
    I will not listen.
Your hands are full of blood!

    16: 
    Wash yourselves clean!
Put away your misdeeds from before my eyes;
    cease doing evil;

    17: 
    learn to do good.
Make justice your aim: redress the wronged,
    hear the orphan’s plea, defend the widow.

    18: 
Come now, let us set things right,
    says the Lord:
Though your sins be like scarlet,
    they may become white as snow;
Though they be red like crimson,
    they may become white as wool.

    19: 
If you are willing, and obey,
    you shall eat the good things of the land;

    20: 
But if you refuse and resist,
    you shall be eaten by the sword:
    for the mouth of the Lord has spoken!
The Purification of Jerusalem

    21: 
How she has become a prostitute,
    the faithful city, so upright!
Justice used to lodge within her,
    but now, murderers.

    22: 
Your silver is turned to dross,
    your wine is mixed with water.

    23: 
Your princes are rebels
    and comrades of thieves;
Each one of them loves a bribe
    and looks for gifts.
The fatherless they do not defend,
    the widow’s plea does not reach them.

    24: 
Now, therefore, says the Lord,
    the Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel:
Ah! I will take vengeance on my foes
    and fully repay my enemies!

    25: 
I will turn my hand against you,
    and refine your dross in the furnace,
    removing all your alloy.

    26: 
I will restore your judges as at first,
    and your counselors as in the beginning;
After that you shall be called
    city of justice, faithful city.

    27: 
Zion shall be redeemed by justice,
    and her repentant ones by righteousness.

    28: 
Rebels and sinners together shall be crushed,
    those who desert the Lord shall be consumed.
Judgment on the Sacred Groves

    29: 
You shall be ashamed of the terebinths which you desired,
    and blush on account of the gardens which you chose.

    30: 
You shall become like a terebinth whose leaves wither,
    like a garden that has no water.

    31: 
The strong tree shall turn to tinder,
    and the one who tends it shall become a spark;
Both of them shall burn together,
    and there shall be none to quench them.


  Chapter 2.

    1: 
    2: 1 This is what Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
Zion, the Royal City of God
2 
    [b]In days to come,
The mountain of the Lord’s house
    shall be established as the highest mountain
    and raised above the hills.
All nations shall stream toward it.

    3: 
    Many peoples shall come and say:
“Come, let us go up to the Lord’s mountain,
    to the house of the God of Jacob,
That he may instruct us in his ways,
    and we may walk in his paths.”
For from Zion shall go forth instruction,
    and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

    4: 
He shall judge between the nations,
    and set terms for many peoples.
They shall beat their swords into plowshares
    and their spears into pruning hooks;
One nation shall not raise the sword against another,
    nor shall they train for war again.

    5: 
House of Jacob, come,
    let us walk in the light of the Lord!
The Lord’s Day of Judgment on Pride

    6: 
You have abandoned your people,
    the house of Jacob!
Because they are filled with diviners,
    and soothsayers, like the Philistines;
    with foreigners they clasp hands.

    7: 
Their land is full of silver and gold,
    there is no end to their treasures;
Their land is full of horses,
    there is no end to their chariots.

    8: 
Their land is full of idols;
    they bow down to the works of their hands,
    what their fingers have made.

    9: So all shall be abased,
    each one brought low.
    Do not pardon them!

    10: 
Get behind the rocks,
    hide in the dust,
From the terror of the Lord
    and the splendor of his majesty!

    11: 
The eyes of human pride shall be lowered,
    the arrogance of mortals shall be abased,
    and the Lord alone will be exalted, on that day.

    12: 
For the Lord of hosts will have his day
    against all that is proud and arrogant,
    against all that is high, and it will be brought low;

    13: 
Yes, against all the cedars of Lebanon
    and against all the oaks of Bashan,

    14: 
Against all the lofty mountains
    and all the high hills,

    15: 
Against every lofty tower
    and every fortified wall,

    16: 
Against all the ships of Tarshish
    and all stately vessels.

    17: 
Then human pride shall be abased,
    the arrogance of mortals brought low,
And the Lord alone will be exalted on that day.

    18: 
    The idols will vanish completely.

    19: 
People will go into caves in the rocks
    and into holes in the earth,
At the terror of the Lord
    and the splendor of his majesty,
    as he rises to overawe the earth.

    20: 
On that day people shall throw to moles and bats
    their idols of silver and their idols of gold
    which they made for themselves to worship.

    21: 
And they shall go into caverns in the rocks
    and into crevices in the cliffs,
At the terror of the Lord
    and the splendor of his majesty,
    as he rises to overawe the earth.

    22: 
As for you, stop worrying about mortals,
    in whose nostrils is but a breath;
    for of what worth are they?


  Chapter 3.

    1: 
The Lord, the Lord of hosts,
    will take away from Jerusalem and from Judah
Support and staff—
    all support of bread,
    all support of water:

    2: 
    3: Judgment on Jerusalem and Judah
1 
The Lord, the Lord of hosts,
    will take away from Jerusalem and from Judah
Support and staff—
    all support of bread,
    all support of water:
2 
Hero and warrior,
    judge and prophet, diviner and elder,
3 
The captain of fifty and the nobleman,
    counselor, skilled magician, and expert charmer.

    4: 
I will place boys as their princes;
    the fickle will govern them,

    5: 
And the people will oppress one another,
    yes, each one the neighbor.
The child will be insolent toward the elder,
    and the base toward the honorable.

    6: 
When anyone seizes a brother
    in their father’s house, saying,
“You have clothes! Be our ruler,
    and take in hand this ruin!”—

    7: 
    He will cry out in that day:
“I cannot be a healer,
    when there is neither bread nor clothing in my own house!
    You will not make me a ruler of the people!”

    8: 
Jerusalem has stumbled, Judah has fallen;
    for their speech and deeds affront the Lord,
    a provocation in the sight of his majesty.

    9: Their very look bears witness against them;
    they boast of their sin like Sodom,
They do not hide it.
    Woe to them!
    They deal out evil to themselves.

    10: 
Happy the just, for it will go well with them,
    the fruit of their works they will eat.

    11: 
Woe to the wicked! It will go ill with them,
    with the work of their hands they will be repaid.

    12: 
My people—infants oppress them,
    women rule over them!
My people, your leaders deceive you,
    they confuse the paths you should follow.

    13: 
The Lord rises to accuse,
    stands to try his people.

    14: 
The Lord enters into judgment
    with the people’s elders and princes:
You, you who have devoured the vineyard;
    the loot wrested from the poor is in your houses.

    15: 
What do you mean by crushing my people,
    and grinding down the faces of the poor?
    says the Lord, the God of hosts.
The Haughty Women of Zion

    16: 
The Lord said:
    Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
    and walk with necks outstretched,
Ogling and mincing as they go,
    their anklets tinkling with every step,

    17: 
The Lord shall cover the scalps of Zion’s daughters with scabs,
    and the Lord shall lay bare their heads.

    18: On that day the Lord will do away with the finery of the anklets, sunbursts, and crescents; 
    19: the pendants, bracelets, and veils; 
    20: the headdresses, bangles, cinctures, perfume boxes, and amulets; 
    21: the signet rings, and the nose rings; 
    22: the court dresses, wraps, cloaks, and purses; 
    23: the lace gowns, linen tunics, turbans, and shawls.

    24: 
Instead of perfume there will be stench,
    instead of a girdle, a rope,
And instead of elaborate coiffure, baldness;
    instead of a rich gown, a sackcloth skirt.
Then, instead of beauty, shame.

    25: 
Your men will fall by the sword,
    and your champions, in war;

    26: 
Her gates will lament and mourn,
    as the city sits desolate on the ground.


  Chapter 4.

    1: 
Seven women will take hold of one man
    on that day, saying:
“We will eat our own food
    and wear our own clothing;
Only let your name be given us,
    put an end to our disgrace!”
Jerusalem Purified

    2: 
    On that day,
The branch[c] of the Lord will be beauty and glory,
    and the fruit of the land will be honor and splendor
    for the survivors of Israel.

    3: 
    4: 1 
Seven women will take hold of one man
    on that day, saying:
“We will eat our own food
    and wear our own clothing;
Only let your name be given us,
    put an end to our disgrace!”
Jerusalem Purified
2 
    [b]On that day,
The branch[c] of the Lord will be beauty and glory,
    and the fruit of the land will be honor and splendor
    for the survivors of Israel.
3 
Everyone who remains in Zion,
    everyone left in Jerusalem
Will be called holy:
    everyone inscribed for life[d] in Jerusalem.
4 
When the Lord washes away
    the filth of the daughters of Zion,
And purges Jerusalem’s blood from her midst
    with a blast of judgment, a searing blast,

    5: 
Then will the Lord create,
    over the whole site of Mount Zion
    and over her place of assembly,
A smoking cloud by day
    and a light of flaming fire by night.

    6: 
For over all, his glory will be shelter and protection:
    shade from the parching heat of day,
    refuge and cover from storm and rain.


End of day 212.
