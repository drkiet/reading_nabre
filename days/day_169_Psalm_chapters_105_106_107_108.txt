    proclaim all his wondrous deeds!

Glory in his holy name;
    let hearts that seek the Lord rejoice!

4 
Seek out the Lord and his might;
    constantly seek his face.
5 
Recall the wondrous deeds he has done,
    his wonders and words of judgment,

    6: 
You descendants of Abraham his servant,
    offspring of Jacob the chosen one!
II

    7: 
He the Lord, is our God
    whose judgments reach through all the earth.

    8: 
He remembers forever his covenant,
    the word he commanded for a thousand generations,

    9:

6 
You descendants of Abraham his servant,

II
7 
He the Lord, is our God
    whose judgments reach through all the earth.
8 
He remembers forever his covenant,
    the word he commanded for a thousand generations,
9 
Which he made with Abraham,
    and swore to Isaac,
10 
And ratified in a statute for Jacob,
    an everlasting covenant for Israel:

    11: 
“To you I give the land of Canaan,
    your own allotted inheritance.”
III

    12: 
When they were few in number,
    a handful, and strangers there,

    13: 
Wandering from nation to nation,
    from one kingdom to another people,

    14: 
He let no one oppress them;
    for their sake he rebuked kings:

    15: 
“Do not touch my anointed ones,
    to my prophets do no harm.”
IV

    16: 
Then he called down a famine on the land,
    destroyed the grain that sustained them.

    17: 
He had sent a man ahead of them,
    Joseph, sold as a slave.

    18: 
They shackled his feet with chains;
    collared his neck in iron,

    19: 
Till his prediction came to pass,
    and the word of the Lord proved him true.

    20: 
The king sent and released him;
    the ruler of peoples set him free.

    21: 
He made him lord over his household,
    ruler over all his possessions,

    22: 
To instruct his princes as he desired,
    to teach his elders wisdom.
V

    23: 
Then Israel entered Egypt;
    Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

    24: 
God greatly increased his people,
    made them more numerous than their foes.

    25: 
He turned their hearts to hate his people,
    to treat his servants deceitfully.

    26: 
He sent his servant Moses,
    and Aaron whom he had chosen.

    27: 
They worked his signs in Egypt
    and wonders in the land of Ham.

    28: 
He sent darkness and it grew dark,
    but they rebelled against his word.

    29: 
He turned their waters into blood
    and killed their fish.

    30: 
Their land swarmed with frogs,
    even the chambers of their kings.

    31: 
He spoke and there came swarms of flies,
    gnats through all their country.

    32: 
For rain he gave them hail,
    flashes of lightning throughout their land.

    33: 
He struck down their vines and fig trees,
    shattered the trees of their country.

    34: 
He spoke and the locusts came,
    grasshoppers without number.

    35: 
They devoured every plant in the land;
    they devoured the crops of their fields.

    36: 
He struck down every firstborn in the land,
    the first fruits of all their vigor.

    37: 
He brought his people out,
    laden with silver and gold;
    no one among the tribes stumbled.

    38: 
Egypt rejoiced when they left,
    for fear had seized them.
VI

    39: 
He spread a cloud out as a cover,
    and made a fire to light up the night.

    40: 
They asked and he brought them quail;
    with bread from heaven he filled them.

    41: 
He split the rock and water gushed forth;
    it flowed through the desert like a river.

    42: 
For he remembered his sacred promise
    to Abraham his servant.

    43: 
He brought his people out with joy,
    his chosen ones with shouts of triumph.

    44: 
He gave them the lands of the nations,
    they took possession of the wealth of the peoples,

    45: 
That they might keep his statutes
    and observe his teachings.
Hallelujah!

Give thanks to the Lord, who is good,
    whose mercy endures forever.

    2: 
Who can recount the mighty deeds of the Lord,
    proclaim in full God’s praise?

    3: 
Blessed those who do what is right,
    whose deeds are always just.

    4: 
Remember me, Lord, as you favor your people;
    come to me with your saving help,

B
6 
We have sinned like our ancestors;
    we have done wrong and are guilty.
I

    7: 
Our ancestors in Egypt
    did not attend to your wonders.
They did not remember your manifold mercy;
    they defied the Most High at the Red Sea.

    8: 
Yet he saved them for his name’s sake
    to make his power known.

B
6 
We have sinned like our ancestors;

I
7 
Our ancestors in Egypt
    did not attend to your wonders.
They did not remember your manifold mercy;
    they defied the Most High at the Red Sea.
8 
Yet he saved them for his name’s sake
    to make his power known.
9 
He roared at the Red Sea and it dried up.
    He led them through the deep as through a desert.
10 
He rescued them from hostile hands,
    freed them from the power of the enemy.

    11: 
The waters covered their oppressors;
    not one of them survived.

    12: 
Then they believed his words
    and sang his praise.
II

    13: 
But they soon forgot all he had done;
    they had no patience for his plan.

    14: 
In the desert they gave in to their cravings,
    tempted God in the wasteland.

    15: 
So he gave them what they asked
    and sent a wasting disease against them.
III

    16: 
In the camp they challenged Moses
    and Aaron, the holy one of the Lord.

    17: 
The earth opened and swallowed Dathan,
    it closed on the followers of Abiram.

    18: 
Against their company the fire blazed;
    flames consumed the wicked.
IV

    19: 
At Horeb they fashioned a calf,
    worshiped a metal statue.

    20: 
They exchanged their glory
    for the image of a grass-eating bull.

    21: 
They forgot the God who had saved them,
    who had done great deeds in Egypt,

    22: 
Amazing deeds in the land of Ham,
    fearsome deeds at the Red Sea.

    23: 
He would have decreed their destruction,
    had not Moses, his chosen one,
Withstood him in the breach
    to turn back his destroying anger.
V

    24: 
Next they despised the beautiful land;
    they did not believe the promise.

    25: 
In their tents they complained;
    they did not heed the voice of the Lord.

    26: 
So with raised hand he swore
    he would destroy them in the desert,

    27: 
And scatter their descendants among the nations,
    disperse them in foreign lands.
VI

    28: 
They joined in the rites of Baal of Peor,
    ate food sacrificed to the dead.

    29: 
They provoked him by their actions,
    and a plague broke out among them.

    30: 
Then Phinehas rose to intervene,
    and the plague was brought to a halt.

    31: 
This was counted for him as a righteous deed
    for all generations to come.
VII

    32: 
At the waters of Meribah they angered God,
    and Moses suffered because of them.

    33: 
They so embittered his spirit
    that rash words crossed his lips.
VIII

    34: 
They did not destroy the peoples
    as the Lord had commanded them,

    35: 
But mingled with the nations
    and imitated their ways.

    36: 
They served their idols
    and were ensnared by them.

    37: 
They sacrificed to demons
    their own sons and daughters,

    38: 
Shedding innocent blood,
    the blood of their own sons and daughters,
Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,
    desecrating the land with bloodshed.

    39: 
They defiled themselves by their actions,
    became adulterers by their conduct.

    40: 
So the Lord grew angry with his people,
    abhorred his own heritage.

    41: 
He handed them over to the nations,
    and their adversaries ruled over them.

    42: 
Their enemies oppressed them,
    kept them under subjection.

    43: 
Many times did he rescue them,
    but they kept rebelling and scheming
    and were brought low by their own guilt.

    44: 
Still God had regard for their affliction
    when he heard their wailing.

    45: 
For their sake he remembered his covenant
    and relented in his abundant mercy,

    46: 
Winning for them compassion
    from all who held them captive.
C

    47: 
Save us, Lord, our God;
    gather us from among the nations
That we may give thanks to your holy name
    and glory in praising you.

    48: 
Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
    from everlasting to everlasting!
    Let all the people say, Amen!
Hallelujah!

II
10 
Some lived in darkness and gloom,
    imprisoned in misery and chains.

    11: 
Because they rebelled against God’s word,
    and scorned the counsel of the Most High,

    12: 
He humbled their hearts through hardship;
    they stumbled with no one to help.

    and broke their chains asunder.
15 
Let them thank the Lord for his mercy,
    such wondrous deeds for the children of Adam.

    16: 
For he broke down the gates of bronze
    and snapped the bars of iron.
III

    17: 
Some fell sick from their wicked ways,
    afflicted because of their sins.

    18: 
They loathed all manner of food;
    they were at the gates of death.

    19: 
In their distress they cried to the Lord,
    who saved them in their peril,

    20: 
Sent forth his word to heal them,
    and snatched them from the grave.

    22: 
Let them offer a sacrifice in thanks,
    recount his works with shouts of joy.
IV

    23: 
Some went off to sea in ships,
    plied their trade on the deep waters.

    24: 
They saw the works of the Lord,
    the wonders of God in the deep.

    25: 
He commanded and roused a storm wind;
    it tossed the waves on high.

    26: 
They rose up to the heavens, sank to the depths;
    their hearts trembled at the danger.

    27: 
They reeled, staggered like drunkards;
    their skill was of no avail.

    28: 
In their distress they cried to the Lord,
    who brought them out of their peril;

    29: 
He hushed the storm to silence,
    the waves of the sea were stilled.

    30: 
They rejoiced that the sea grew calm,
    that God brought them to the harbor they longed for.

    31: 
Let them thank the Lord for his mercy,
    such wondrous deeds for the children of Adam.

    32: 
Let them extol him in the assembly of the people,
    and praise him in the council of the elders.
V

    33: 
God changed rivers into desert,
    springs of water into thirsty ground,

    34: 
Fruitful land into a salty waste,
    because of the wickedness of its people.

    35: 
He changed the desert into pools of water,
    arid land into springs of water,

    36: 
And settled the hungry there;
    they built a city to live in.

    37: 
They sowed fields and planted vineyards,
    brought in an abundant harvest.

    38: 
God blessed them, and they increased greatly,
    and their livestock did not decrease.

    39: 
But he poured out contempt on princes,
    made them wander trackless wastes,

    40: 
Where they were diminished and brought low
    through misery and cruel oppression.

    41: 
While he released the poor man from affliction,
    and increased their families like flocks.

    42: 
The upright saw this and rejoiced;
    all wickedness shut its mouth.

    43: 
Whoever is wise will take note of these things,
    and ponder the merciful deeds of the Lord.

We will triumph with the help of God,
    who will trample down our foes.
