Day 161:

Reading Psalm, chapters ['73', '74', '75', '76']:

  Chapter 73.

    1: A psalm of Asaph.
How good God is to the upright,
    to those who are pure of heart!
I

    2: 
    3: 89
Psalm 73
The Trial of the Just
1 A psalm of Asaph.
How good God is to the upright,
    to those who are pure of heart!
I
2 
But, as for me, my feet had almost stumbled;
    my steps had nearly slipped,
3 
Because I was envious of the arrogant
    when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

    4: 
For they suffer no pain;
    their bodies are healthy and sleek.

    5: 
They are free of the burdens of life;
    they are not afflicted like others.

    6:

The Trial of the Just
1 A psalm of Asaph.
How good God is to the upright,
    to those who are pure of heart!
I
2 
But, as for me, my feet had almost stumbled;
    my steps had nearly slipped,
3 
Because I was envious of the arrogant
    when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
4 
For they suffer no pain;
    their bodies are healthy and sleek.
5 
They are free of the burdens of life;
    they are not afflicted like others.
6 
Thus pride adorns them as a necklace;
    violence clothes them as a robe.
7 
Out of such blindness comes sin;
    evil thoughts flood their hearts.
8 
They scoff and spout their malice;
    from on high they utter threats.
9 
[b]They set their mouths against the heavens,
    their tongues roam the earth.

    10: 
So my people turn to them
    and drink deeply of their words.

    11: 
They say, “Does God really know?”
    “Does the Most High have any knowledge?”

    12: 
Such, then, are the wicked,
    always carefree, increasing their wealth.
II

    13: 
Is it in vain that I have kept my heart pure,
    washed my hands in innocence?

    14: 
For I am afflicted day after day,
    chastised every morning.

    15: 
Had I thought, “I will speak as they do,”
    I would have betrayed this generation of your children.

    16: 
Though I tried to understand all this,
    it was too difficult for me,

    17: 
Till I entered the sanctuary of God
    and came to understand their end.
III

    18: 
You set them, indeed, on a slippery road;
    you hurl them down to ruin.

    19: 
How suddenly they are devastated;
    utterly undone by disaster!

    20: 
They are like a dream after waking, Lord,
    dismissed like shadows when you arise.
IV

    21: 
Since my heart was embittered
    and my soul deeply wounded,

    22: 
I was stupid and could not understand;
    I was like a brute beast in your presence.

    23: 
Yet I am always with you;
    you take hold of my right hand.

    24: 
With your counsel you guide me,
    and at the end receive me with honor.

    25: 
Whom else have I in the heavens?
    None beside you delights me on earth.

    26: 
Though my flesh and my heart fail,
    God is the rock of my heart, my portion forever.

    27: 
But those who are far from you perish;
    you destroy those unfaithful to you.

    28: 
As for me, to be near God is my good,
    to make the Lord God my refuge.
I shall declare all your works
    in the gates of daughter Zion.


  Chapter 74.

    1: A maskil of Asaph.
I
Why, God, have you cast us off forever?
    Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture?

    2: 
Remember your people, whom you acquired of old,
    the tribe you redeemed as your own heritage,
    Mount Zion where you dwell.

    3: 
    4: a]
Prayer at the Destruction of the Temple
1 A maskil of Asaph.
I
Why, God, have you cast us off forever?[b]
    Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture?
2 
Remember your people, whom you acquired of old,
    the tribe you redeemed as your own heritage,
    Mount Zion where you dwell.
3 
Direct your steps toward the utter destruction,
    everything the enemy laid waste in the sanctuary.
4 
Your foes roared triumphantly in the place of your assembly;
    they set up their own tokens of victory.

    5: 
They hacked away like a forester gathering boughs,
    swinging his ax in a thicket of trees.

    6: 
    7: 
Prayer at the Destruction of the Temple
1 A maskil of Asaph.
I
Why, God, have you cast us off forever?[b]
    Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture?
2 
Remember your people, whom you acquired of old,
    the tribe you redeemed as your own heritage,
    Mount Zion where you dwell.
3 
Direct your steps toward the utter destruction,
    everything the enemy laid waste in the sanctuary.
4 
Your foes roared triumphantly in the place of your assembly;
    they set up their own tokens of victory.
5 
They hacked away like a forester gathering boughs,
    swinging his ax in a thicket of trees.
6 
They smashed all its engraved work,
    struck it with ax and pick.
7 
They set your sanctuary on fire,
    profaned your name’s abode by razing it to the ground.

    8: 
They said in their hearts, “We will destroy them all!
    Burn all the assembly-places of God in the land!”

    9: Even so we have seen no signs for us,
    there is no prophet any more,
    no one among us who knows for how long.

    10: 
How long, O God, will the enemy jeer?
    Will the enemy revile your name forever?

    11: 
Why draw back your hand,
    why hold back your right hand within your bosom?
II

    12: 
Yet you, God, are my king from of old,
    winning victories throughout the earth.

    13: 
You stirred up the sea by your might;
    you smashed the heads of the dragons on the waters.

    14: 
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
    gave him as food to the sharks.

    15: 
You opened up springs and torrents,
    brought dry land out of the primeval waters.

    16: 
Yours the day and yours the night too;
    you set the moon and sun in place.

    17: 
You fixed all the limits of the earth;
    summer and winter you made.

    18: 
Remember how the enemy has jeered, Lord,
    how a foolish people has reviled your name.

    19: 
Do not surrender to wild animals those who praise you;
    do not forget forever the life of your afflicted.

    20: 
Look to your covenant,
    for the recesses of the land
    are full of the haunts of violence.

    21: 
Let not the oppressed turn back in shame;
    may the poor and needy praise your name.

    22: 
Arise, God, defend your cause;
    remember the constant jeering of the fools.

    23: 
Do not forget the clamor of your foes,
    the unceasing uproar of your enemies.


  Chapter 75.

    1: For the leader. Do not destroy! A psalm of Asaph; a song.
I

    2: 
We thank you, God, we give thanks;
    we call upon your name,
    we declare your wonderful deeds.
[b]

    3: 
“I will choose the time;
    I will judge fairly.

    4: 
    5: a]
God the Judge of the World

2 
We thank you, God, we give thanks;
    we call upon your name,
    we declare your wonderful deeds.
[You said:][b]
3 
“I will choose the time;
    I will judge fairly.
4 
Though the earth and all its inhabitants quake,
    I make steady its pillars.”
Selah
II
5 
So I say to the boastful: “Do not boast!”
    to the wicked: “Do not raise your horns![c]

5 
So I say to the boastful: “Do not boast!”
    to the wicked: “Do not raise your horns![c]
6 
Do not raise your horns against heaven!
    Do not speak with a stiff neck!”
7 
For judgment comes not from east or from west,
    not from the wilderness or the mountains,

    8: 
But from God who decides,
    who brings some low and raises others high.

    9: Yes, a cup is in the Lord’s hand,
    foaming wine, fully spiced.
When God pours it out,
    they will drain it even to the dregs;
    all the wicked of the earth will drink.

    10: 
But I will rejoice forever;
    I will sing praise to the God of Jacob,

    11: 

“I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,
    but the horns of the righteous will be exalted.”

I

    2: 
Renowned in Judah is God,
    whose name is great in Israel.

    3: 
On Salem is God’s tent, his shelter on Zion.

    4: 
    There the flashing arrows were shattered,
    shield, sword, and weapons of war.
Selah

On Salem[b] is God’s tent, his shelter on Zion.

Selah
II
5 
Terrible and awesome are you,
    stronger than the ancient mountains.[c]
6 
Despoiled are the stouthearted;
    they sank into sleep;
    the hands of all the men of valor have failed.
7 
At your roar, O God of Jacob,
    chariot and steed lay still.

    8: 
You, terrible are you;
    who can stand before you and your great anger?

    9: From the heavens you pronounced sentence;
    the earth was terrified and reduced to silence,

    10: 
When you arose, O God, for judgment
    to save the afflicted of the land.
Selah

    11: 
Surely the wrath of man will give you thanks;
    the remnant of your furor will keep your feast.
III

    12: 
Make and keep vows to the Lord your God.
    May all around him bring gifts to the one to be feared,

    13: 
Who checks the spirit of princes,
    who is fearful to the kings of earth.
