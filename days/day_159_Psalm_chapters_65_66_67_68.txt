    O God on Zion;
To you our vows[b] must be fulfilled,
3 
    [c]you who hear our prayers.

We are overcome by our sins;

You answer us with awesome deeds[d] of justice,
    O God our savior,
The hope of all the ends of the earth
    and of those far off across the sea.

    7: 
You are robed in power,
    you set up the mountains by your might.

    8: 
You still the roaring of the seas,
    the roaring of their waves,
    the tumult of the peoples.

    9: Distant peoples stand in awe of your marvels;
    the places of morning and evening you make resound with joy.

    10: 
You visit the earth and water it,
    make it abundantly fertile.
God’s stream[f] is filled with water;
    you supply their grain.
Thus do you prepare it:

    11: 
    you drench its plowed furrows,
    and level its ridges.
With showers you keep it soft,
    blessing its young sprouts.

    12: 
You adorn the year with your bounty;
    your paths drip with fruitful rain.

    13: 
The meadows of the wilderness also drip;
    the hills are robed with joy.

    14: 
The pastures are clothed with flocks,
    the valleys blanketed with grain;
    they cheer and sing for joy.

His eyes are fixed upon the nations.
    Let no rebel rise to challenge!

    9: Who has kept us alive
    and not allowed our feet to slip.

    10: 
You tested us, O God,
    tried us as silver tried by fire.

    11: 
You led us into a snare;
    you bound us at the waist as captives.

    12: 
You let captors set foot on our neck;
    we went through fire and water;
    then you led us out to freedom.
III

    13: 
I will bring burnt offerings to your house;
    to you I will fulfill my vows,

    14: 
Which my lips pronounced
    and my mouth spoke in my distress.

Burnt offerings of fatlings I will offer you
    and sacrificial smoke of rams;
    I will sacrifice oxen and goats.
Selah

    16: 
Come and hear, all you who fear God,
    while I recount what has been done for me.

    17: 
I called to him with my mouth;
    praise was upon my tongue.

    18: 
Had I cherished evil in my heart,
    the Lord would not have heard.

    19: 
But God did hear
    and listened to my voice in prayer.

Blessed be God, who did not reject my prayer
    and refuse his mercy.

God, when you went forth before your people,
    when you marched through the desert,
Selah

    9: The earth quaked, the heavens poured,
    before God, the One of Sinai,
    before God, the God of Israel.

    10: 
You poured abundant rains, God,
    your inheritance was weak and you repaired it.

    11: 
Your creatures dwelt in it;
    you will establish it in your goodness for the poor, O God.

The Lord announced:

Every household will share the spoil,

    14: 
    though you lie down among the sheepfolds,
    you shall be covered with silver as the wings of a dove,
    her feathers bright as fine gold.”

When the Almighty routs the kings there,
    it will be as when snow fell on Zalmon.

You mountain of God, mountain of Bashan,
    you rugged mountain, mountain of Bashan,

    17: 
You rugged mountains, why look with envy
    at the mountain where God has chosen to dwell,
    where the Lord resides forever?

    18: 
God’s chariots were myriad, thousands upon thousands;
    from Sinai the Lord entered the holy place.

You went up to its lofty height;
    you took captives, received slaves as tribute,

The Lord has said:
    “Even from Bashan I will fetch them,

    the tongues of your dogs will lap it up.”
VII

    25: 
Your procession comes into view, O God,
    your procession into the holy place, my God and king.

    27: 
In your choirs, bless God;
    Lord, Israel’s fountain.

    28: 
In the lead is Benjamin, few in number;
    there the princes of Judah, a large throng,
    the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali, too.
VIII

    29: 
Summon again, O God, your power,
    the divine power you once showed for us,

    30: 
From your temple on behalf of Jerusalem,
    that kings may bring you tribute.

    31: 
Roar at the wild beast of the reeds,
    the herd of mighty bulls, the calves of the peoples;
    trampling those who lust after silver
    scatter the peoples that delight in war.

    32: 
Let bronze be brought from Egypt,
    Ethiopia hurry its hands to God.
IX

    33: 
You kingdoms of the earth, sing to God;
    chant the praises of the Lord,
Selah

    34: 
Who rides the heights of the ancient heavens,
    Who sends forth his voice as a mighty voice?

Confess the power of God,
    whose majesty protects Israel,
    whose power is in the sky.

    who gives power and strength to his people.
Blessed be God!
