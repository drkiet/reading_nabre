Day 264:

Reading Hosea, chapters ['9', '10', '11', '12']:

  Chapter 9.

    1: 
Do not rejoice, Israel,
    do not exult like the nations!
For you have prostituted yourself, abandoning your God,
    loving a prostitute’s fee
    upon every threshing floor.

    2: 
Threshing floor and wine press will not nourish them,
    the new wine will fail them.

    3: 
They will not dwell in the Lord’s land;
    Ephraim will return to Egypt,
    and in Assyria they will eat unclean food.

    4: 
They will not pour libations of wine to the Lord,
    and their sacrifices will not please him.
Their bread will be like mourners’ bread,
    that makes unclean all who eat of it;
Their food will be for their own appetites;
    it cannot enter the house of the Lord.

    5: 
What will you do on the festival day,
    the day of the Lord’s feast?

    6: 
When they flee from the devastation,
    Egypt will gather them, Memphis will bury them.
Weeds will overgrow their silver treasures,
    and thorns, their tents.

    7: 
They have come, the days of punishment!
    they have come, the days of recompense!
Let Israel know it!
    “The prophet is a fool,
    the man of the spirit is mad!”
Because your iniquity is great,
    great, too, is your hostility.

    8: 
    9: rom Days of Celebration to Days of Punishment
1 
Do not rejoice, Israel,
    do not exult like the nations!
For you have prostituted yourself, abandoning your God,
    loving a prostitute’s fee
    upon every threshing floor.
2 
Threshing floor and wine press will not nourish them,
    the new wine will fail them.
3 
They will not dwell in the Lord’s land;
    Ephraim will return to Egypt,
    and in Assyria they will eat unclean food.
4 
They will not pour libations of wine to the Lord,
    and their sacrifices will not please him.
Their bread will be like mourners’ bread,[b]
    that makes unclean all who eat of it;
Their food will be for their own appetites;
    it cannot enter the house of the Lord.
5 
What will you do on the festival day,
    the day of the Lord’s feast?[c]
6 
[d]When they flee from the devastation,
    Egypt will gather them, Memphis will bury them.
Weeds will overgrow their silver treasures,
    and thorns, their tents.
7 
They have come, the days of punishment!
    they have come, the days of recompense!
Let Israel know it!
    “The prophet is a fool,
    the man of the spirit is mad!”
Because your iniquity is great,
    great, too, is your hostility.
8 
[e]The watchman of Ephraim, the people of my God, is the prophet;
    yet a fowler’s snare is on all his ways,
    hostility in the house of his God.
9 
They have sunk to the depths of corruption,
    as in the days of Gibeah;[f]
God will remember their iniquity
    and punish their sins.
From Former Glory to a History of Corruption

    10: 
Like grapes in the desert,
    I found Israel;
Like the first fruits of the fig tree, its first to ripen,
    I looked on your ancestors.
But when they came to Baal-peor
    and consecrated themselves to the Shameful One,
    they became as abhorrent as the thing they loved.

    11: 
Ephraim is like a bird:
    their glory flies away—
    no birth, no pregnancy, no conception.

    12: 
Even though they bring up their children,
    I will make them childless, until no one is left.
Indeed, woe to them
    when I turn away from them!

    13: 
Ephraim, as I saw, was a tree
    planted in a meadow;
But now Ephraim will bring out
    his children to the slaughterer!

    14: 
Give them, Lord!
    give them what?
Give them a miscarrying womb,
    and dry breasts!

    15: 
All their misfortune began in Gilgal;
    yes, there I rejected them.
Because of their wicked deeds
    I will drive them out of my house.
I will love them no longer;
    all their princes are rebels.

    16: 
Ephraim is stricken,
    their root is dried up;
    they will bear no fruit.
Were they to bear children,
    I would slay the beloved of their womb.

    17: 
My God will disown them
    because they have not listened to him;
    they will be wanderers among the nations.


  Chapter 10.

    1: 
Destruction of Idolatrous Cultic Objects
1 
Israel is a luxuriant vine
    whose fruit matches its growth.
The more abundant his fruit,
    the more altars he built;
The more productive his land,
    the more sacred pillars he set up.

    2: 
Their heart is false!
    Now they will pay for their guilt:
God will break down their altars
    and destroy their sacred pillars.

    3: 
For now they will say,
    “We have no king!
Since we do not fear the Lord,
    the king—what could he do for us?”

    4: 
They make promises,
    swear false oaths, and make covenants,
While lawsuits sprout
    like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field!

    5: 
The inhabitants of Samaria are afraid
    for the calf of Beth-aven;
Its people mourn for it
    and its idolatrous priests wail over it,
    —over its glory which has departed from it.

    6: 
It too will be carried to Assyria,
    as an offering to the great king.
Ephraim will be put to shame,
    Israel will be shamed by his schemes.

    7: 
Samaria and her king will disappear,
    like a twig upon the waters.

    8: 
The high places of Aven will be destroyed,
    the sin of Israel;
    thorns and thistles will overgrow their altars.
Then they will cry out to the mountains, “Cover us!”
    and to the hills, “Fall upon us!”
War Because of Israel’s Wickedness

    9: 
    10: Destruction of Idolatrous Cultic Objects
1 
Israel is a luxuriant vine
    whose fruit matches its growth.
The more abundant his fruit,
    the more altars he built;
The more productive his land,
    the more sacred pillars he set up.
2 
Their heart is false!
    Now they will pay for their guilt:
God will break down their altars
    and destroy their sacred pillars.
3 
For now they will say,
    “We have no king![b]
Since we do not fear the Lord,
    the king—what could he do for us?”
4 
They make promises,
    swear false oaths, and make covenants,
While lawsuits sprout
    like poisonous weeds[c] in the furrows of a field!
5 
The inhabitants of Samaria are afraid
    for the calf of Beth-aven;[d]
Its people mourn for it
    and its idolatrous priests wail over it,
    —over its glory which has departed from it.
6 
It too will be carried to Assyria,
    as an offering to the great king.[e]
Ephraim will be put to shame,
    Israel will be shamed by his schemes.
7 
Samaria and her king will disappear,
    like a twig upon the waters.
8 
The high places of Aven[f] will be destroyed,
    the sin of Israel;
    thorns and thistles will overgrow their altars.
Then they will cry out to the mountains, “Cover us!”
    and to the hills, “Fall upon us!”
War Because of Israel’s Wickedness
9 
Since the days of Gibeah
    you have sinned, Israel.
There they took their stand;
    will war not reach them in Gibeah?
Against a perverse people
10 
    I came and I chastised them;
Peoples will be gathered against them
    when I bind them to their two crimes.[g]

    11: 
Ephraim was a trained heifer,
    that loved to thresh;
I myself laid a yoke
    upon her beautiful neck;
I will make Ephraim break ground, Judah must plow,
    Jacob must harrow for himself:

    12: 
“Sow for yourselves justice,
    reap the reward of loyalty;
Break up for yourselves a new field,
    for it is time to seek the Lord,
    till he comes and rains justice upon you.”

    13: 
But you have plowed wickedness,
    reaped perversity,
    and eaten the fruit of falsehood.
Because you have trusted in your own power,
    and in your many warriors,

    14: 
The clamor of war shall break out among your people
    and all your fortresses shall be ravaged
As Salman ravaged Beth-arbel on the day of war,
    smashing mothers along with their children.

    15: 
So it will be done to you, Bethel,
    because of your utter wickedness:
At dawn the king of Israel
    will utterly disappear.


  Chapter 11.

    1: 
The Disappointment of a Parent
1 
When Israel was a child I loved him,
    out of Egypt[b] I called my son.

    2: 
The more I called them,
    the farther they went from me,
Sacrificing to the Baals
    and burning incense to idols.

    3: 
Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk,
    who took them in my arms;
    but they did not know that I cared for them.

    4: 
I drew them with human cords,
    with bands of love;
I fostered them like those
    who raise an infant to their cheeks;
    I bent down to feed them.

    5: 
He shall return to the land of Egypt,
    Assyria shall be his king,
    because they have refused to repent.

    6: 
The sword shall rage in his cities:
    it shall destroy his diviners,
    and devour them because of their schemings.

    7: 
My people have their mind set on apostasy;
    though they call on God in unison,
    he shall not raise them up.
But Love Is Stronger and Restores

    8: 
How could I give you up, Ephraim,
    or deliver you up, Israel?
How could I treat you as Admah,
    or make you like Zeboiim?
My heart is overwhelmed,
    my pity is stirred.

    9: I will not give vent to my blazing anger,
    I will not destroy Ephraim again;
For I am God and not a man,
    the Holy One present among you;
    I will not come in wrath.

    10: 
    11: The Disappointment of a Parent
1 
When Israel was a child I loved him,
    out of Egypt[b] I called my son.
2 
The more I called them,
    the farther they went from me,
Sacrificing to the Baals
    and burning incense to idols.
3 
Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk,
    who took them in my arms;
    but they did not know that I cared for them.
4 
I drew them with human cords,
    with bands of love;[c]
I fostered them like those
    who raise an infant to their cheeks;
    I bent down to feed them.
5 
He shall return to the land of Egypt,
    Assyria shall be his king,
    because they have refused to repent.
6 
The sword shall rage in his cities:
    it shall destroy his diviners,
    and devour them because of their schemings.
7 
My people have their mind set on apostasy;
    though they call on God in unison,
    he shall not raise them up.
But Love Is Stronger and Restores
8 
How could I give you up, Ephraim,
    or deliver you up, Israel?
How could I treat you as Admah,
    or make you like Zeboiim?[d]
My heart is overwhelmed,
    my pity is stirred.
9 
I will not give vent to my blazing anger,
    I will not destroy Ephraim again;
For I am God and not a man,
    the Holy One present among you;
    I will not come in wrath.
10 
They shall follow the Lord,
    who roars like a lion;
When he roars,
    his children shall come frightened from the west,
11 
Out of Egypt they shall come trembling, like birds,
    like doves, from the land of Assyria;
And I will resettle them in their homes,
    oracle of the Lord.


  Chapter 12.

    1: 
    2: Infidelity of Israel
1 
Ephraim has surrounded me with lies,
    the house of Israel, with deceit;
Judah still wanders about with gods,
    and is faithful to holy ones.[b]
2 
[c]Ephraim shepherds the wind,
    and pursues the east wind all day long.
He multiplies lies and violence:
    They make a covenant with Assyria,
    and oil is carried to Egypt.

    3: 
The Lord has a dispute with Judah,
    and will punish Jacob for his conduct,
    and repay him for his deeds.

    4: 
In the womb he supplanted his brother,
    and in his vigor he contended with a divine being;

    5: 
He contended with an angel and prevailed,
    he wept and entreated him.
At Bethel he met with him,
    and there he spoke with him.

    6: 
The Lord is the God of hosts,
    the Lord is his name!

    7: 
You must return to your God.
    Maintain loyalty and justice
    and always hope in your God.

    8: 
A merchant who holds a false balance,
    he loves to extort!

    9: Ephraim has said,
    “How rich I have become;
    I have made a fortune!”
All his gain will not suffice
    for the guilt of his sin.

    10: 
I the Lord have been your God,
    since the land of Egypt;
I will again have you live in tents,
    as on feast days.

    11: 
    12: Infidelity of Israel

    the house of Israel, with deceit;

    and is faithful to holy ones.[b]

    and will punish Jacob[d] for his conduct,
    and repay him for his deeds.

    and in his vigor he contended with a divine being;
5

    for the guilt of his sin.
10 
I the Lord have been your God,
    since the land of Egypt;
I will again have you live in tents,
    as on feast days.
11 
I spoke to the prophets,
    I granted many visions,
    and through the prophets I told parables.
12 
In Gilead is falsehood, they have come to nothing;
    in Gilgal they sacrifice bulls,
But their altars are like heaps of stones
    in the furrows of the field.

    13: 
Jacob fled to the land of Aram,
    and Israel served for a wife;
    for a wife he tended sheep.

    14: 
But by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt,
    and by a prophet Israel was tended.

    15: 
Ephraim has aroused bitter anger,
    so his Lord shall cast his bloodguilt upon him
    and repay him for his scorn.
