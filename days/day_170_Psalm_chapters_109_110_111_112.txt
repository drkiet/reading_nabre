    1: 9
Prayer of a Person Falsely Accused
1 For the leader. A psalm of David.
I

    2: 
O God, whom I praise, do not be silent,
    for wicked and treacherous mouths attack me.
They speak against me with lying tongues;

    3: 
    with hateful words they surround me,
    attacking me without cause.

    4: 
In return for my love they slander me,
    even though I prayed for them.

    5: 
They repay me evil for good,
    hatred for my love.
II

    6: 
Appoint an evil one over him,
    an accuser to stand at his right hand,

    7: 
That he may be judged and found guilty,
    that his plea may be in vain.

    8:

    10: 
Prayer of a Person Falsely Accused

I
2 
O God, whom I praise, do not be silent,
    for wicked and treacherous mouths attack me.
They speak against me with lying tongues;
3 
    with hateful words they surround me,
    attacking me without cause.
4 
In return for my love they slander me,
    even though I prayed for them.
5 
They repay me evil for good,
    hatred for my love.
II
6 
Appoint an evil one over him,
    an accuser[b] to stand at his right hand,
7 
That he may be judged and found guilty,
    that his plea may be in vain.
8 
May his days be few;
    may another take his office.
9 
May his children be fatherless,
    his wife, a widow.
10 
May his children wander and beg,
    driven from their hovels.

    11: 
May the usurer snare all he owns,
    strangers plunder all he earns.

    12: 
May no one treat him with mercy
    or pity his fatherless children.

    13: 
May his posterity be destroyed,
    their name rooted out in the next generation.

    14: 
May his fathers’ guilt be mentioned to the Lord;
    his mother’s sin not rooted out.

    15: 
May their guilt be always before the Lord,
    till their memory is banished from the earth,

    16: 
For he did not remember to show mercy,
    but hounded the wretched poor
    and brought death to the brokenhearted.

    17: 
He loved cursing; may it come upon him;
    he hated blessing; may none come to him.

    18: 
May cursing clothe him like a robe;
    may it enter his belly like water,
    his bones like oil.

    19: 
May it be near as the clothes he wears,
    as the belt always around him.

    20: 
May this be the reward for my accusers from the Lord,
    for those speaking evil against me.
III

    21: 
But you, Lord, are my Lord,
    deal kindly with me for your name’s sake;
    in your great mercy rescue me.

    22: 
For I am poor and needy;
    my heart is pierced within me.

    23: 
Like a lengthening shadow I am gone,
    I am shaken off like the locust.

    24: 
My knees totter from fasting;
    my flesh has wasted away.

    25: 
I have become a mockery to them;
    when they see me, they shake their heads.

    26: 
Help me, Lord, my God;
    save me in your mercy.

    27: 
Make them know this is your hand,
    that you, Lord, have done this.

    28: 
Though they curse, may you bless;
    arise, shame them, that your servant may rejoice.

    29: 
Clothe my accusers with disgrace;
    make them wear their shame like a mantle.

    30: 
I will give fervent thanks to the Lord;
    before a crowd I will praise him.

    31: 
For he stands at the right hand of the poor
    to save him from those who pass judgment on him.


  Chapter 110.

    1: 0
God Appoints the King both King and Priest
1 A psalm of David.
The Lord says to my lord:[b]
    “Sit at my right hand,
    while I make your enemies your footstool.”

    2: 
The scepter of your might:
    the Lord extends your strong scepter from Zion.
    Have dominion over your enemies!

    3: 
Yours is princely power from the day of your birth.
    In holy splendor before the daystar,
    like dew I begot you.

    4: 
The Lord has sworn and will not waver:
    “You are a priest forever in the manner of Melchizedek.”

    5: 
At your right hand is the Lord,
    who crushes kings on the day of his wrath,

    6: 
Who judges nations, heaps up corpses,
    crushes heads across the wide earth,

    7: 
Who drinks from the brook by the wayside
    and thus holds high his head.
