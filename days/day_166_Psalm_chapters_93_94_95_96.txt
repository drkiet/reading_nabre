Day 166:

Reading Psalm, chapters ['93', '94', '95', '96']:

  Chapter 93.

    1: 
The Lord is king, robed with majesty;
    the Lord is robed, girded with might.
The world will surely stand in place,
    never to be moved.

    2: 
    3: a]
God Is a Mighty King
1 
The Lord is king,[b] robed with majesty;
    the Lord is robed, girded with might.
The world will surely stand in place,
    never to be moved.
2 
Your throne stands firm from of old;
    you are from everlasting.
3 
[c]The flood has raised up, Lord;
    the flood has raised up its roar;
    the flood has raised its pounding waves.

    4: 
More powerful than the roar of many waters,
    more powerful than the breakers of the sea,
    powerful in the heavens is the Lord.

    5: 
Your decrees are firmly established;
    holiness befits your house, Lord,
    for all the length of days.


  Chapter 94.

    1: 
Lord, avenging God,
    avenging God, shine forth!

    2: 
Rise up, O judge of the earth;
    give the proud what they deserve!
II

Lord, avenging God,
    avenging God, shine forth!
2 
Rise up, O judge of the earth;
    give the proud what they deserve!
II
3 
How long, Lord, shall the wicked,
    how long shall the wicked glory?
4 
How long will they mouth haughty speeches,
    go on boasting, all these evildoers?

    5: 
They crush your people, Lord,
    torment your very own.

    6: 
They kill the widow and alien;
    the orphan they murder.

    7: 
They say, “The Lord does not see;
    the God of Jacob takes no notice.”
III

    8: 
    9: a]
A Prayer for Deliverance from the Wicked
I
1 
Lord, avenging God,
    avenging God, shine forth!
2 
Rise up, O judge of the earth;
    give the proud what they deserve!
II
3 
How long, Lord, shall the wicked,
    how long shall the wicked glory?
4 
How long will they mouth haughty speeches,
    go on boasting, all these evildoers?
5

    torment your very own.
6 
They kill the widow and alien;
    the orphan they murder.
7 
They say, “The Lord does not see;
    the God of Jacob takes no notice.”
III
8 
Understand, you stupid people!
    You fools, when will you be wise?
9 
Does the one who shaped the ear not hear?
    The one who formed the eye not see?

    10: 
Does the one who guides nations not rebuke?
    The one who teaches man not have knowledge?

    11: 
The Lord knows the plans of man;
    they are like a fleeting breath.
IV

    12: 
Blessed the one whom you guide, Lord,
    whom you teach by your instruction,

    13: 
To give rest from evil days,
    while a pit is being dug for the wicked.

    14: 
For the Lord will not forsake his people,
    nor abandon his inheritance.

    15: 
Judgment shall again be just,
    and all the upright of heart will follow it.
V

    16: 
Who will rise up for me against the wicked?
    Who will stand up for me against evildoers?

    17: 
If the Lord were not my help,
    I would long have been silent in the grave.

    18: 
When I say, “My foot is slipping,”
    your mercy, Lord, holds me up.

    19: 
When cares increase within me,
    your comfort gives me joy.
VI

    20: 
Can unjust judges be your allies,
    those who create burdens by decree,

    21: 
Those who conspire against the just
    and condemn the innocent to death?

    22: 
No, the Lord is my secure height,
    my God, my rock of refuge,

    23: 
Who will turn back their evil upon them
    and destroy them for their wickedness.
    Surely the Lord our God will destroy them!

Let us come before him with a song of praise,
    joyfully sing out our psalms.

    3:

    who owns the tops of the mountains.
5 
The sea and dry land belong to God,
    who made them, formed them by hand.
II

    6: 
Enter, let us bow down in worship;
    let us kneel before the Lord who made us.

    7: 
For he is our God,
    we are the people he shepherds,
    the sheep in his hands.
III
Oh, that today you would hear his voice:

III
Oh, that today you would hear his voice:
8 
    Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah,
    as on the day of Massah in the desert.[b]
9 
There your ancestors tested me;
    they tried me though they had seen my works.

    10: 
Forty years I loathed that generation;
    I said: “This people’s heart goes astray;
    they do not know my ways.”

    11: 
Therefore I swore in my anger:
    “They shall never enter my rest.”

The world will surely stand fast, never to be shaken.
    He rules the peoples with fairness.

    11: 
Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice;
    let the sea and what fills it resound;

    12: 
    let the plains be joyful and all that is in them.
Then let all the trees of the forest rejoice

    13: 
    before the Lord who comes,
    who comes to govern the earth,
To govern the world with justice
    and the peoples with faithfulness.
