Day 198:

Reading Wisdom, chapters ['17', '18', '19']:

  Chapter 17.

    1: 
Fourth Example: Darkness Afflicts the Egyptians, While the Israelites Have Light
1 
For great are your judgments, and hard to describe;
    therefore the unruly souls went astray.

    2: 
For when the lawless thought to enslave the holy nation,
    they themselves lay shackled with darkness, fettered by the long night,
    confined beneath their own roofs as exiles from the eternal providence.

    3: 
For they, who supposed their secret sins were hid
    under the dark veil of oblivion,
Were scattered in fearful trembling,
    terrified by apparitions.

    4: 
For not even their inner chambers kept them unafraid,
    for crashing sounds on all sides terrified them,
    and mute phantoms with somber looks appeared.

    5: 
No fire had force enough to give light,
    nor did the flaming brilliance of the stars
    succeed in lighting up that gloomy night.

    6: 
    7: Fourth Example: Darkness Afflicts the Egyptians, While the Israelites Have Light
1 
For great are your judgments, and hard to describe;
    therefore the unruly souls went astray.
2 
For when the lawless thought to enslave the holy nation,
    they themselves lay shackled with darkness, fettered by the long night,
    confined beneath their own roofs as exiles from the eternal providence.
3 
For they, who supposed their secret sins were hid
    under the dark veil of oblivion,
Were scattered in fearful trembling,
    terrified by apparitions.
4 
For not even their inner chambers kept them unafraid,
    for crashing sounds on all sides terrified them,
    and mute phantoms with somber looks appeared.
5 
No fire had force enough to give light,
    nor did the flaming brilliance of the stars
    succeed in lighting up that gloomy night.
6 
But only intermittent, fearful fires
    flashed through upon them;
And in their terror they thought beholding these was worse
    than the times when that sight was no longer to be seen.
7 
And mockeries of their magic art[b] failed,
    and there was a humiliating refutation of their vaunted shrewdness.

    8: 
For they who undertook to banish fears and terrors from the sick soul
    themselves sickened with ridiculous fear.

    9: For even though no monstrous thing frightened them,
    they shook at the passing of insects and the hissing of reptiles,

    10: 
And perished trembling,
    reluctant to face even the air that they could nowhere escape.

    11: 
For wickedness, of its nature cowardly, testifies in its own condemnation,
    and because of a distressed conscience, always magnifies misfortunes.

    12: 
For fear is nought but the surrender of the helps that come from reason;

    13: 
    and the more one’s expectation is of itself uncertain,
    the more one makes of not knowing the cause that brings on torment.

    14: 
So they, during that night, powerless though it was,
    since it had come upon them from the recesses of a powerless Hades,
    while all sleeping the same sleep,

    15: 
Were partly smitten by fearsome apparitions
    and partly stricken by their souls’ surrender;
    for fear overwhelmed them, sudden and unexpected.

    16:

12

13 
    and the more one’s expectation is of itself uncertain,
    the more one makes of not knowing the cause that brings on torment.
14 
So they, during that night, powerless though it was,
    since it had come upon them from the recesses of a powerless[c] Hades,
    while all sleeping the same sleep,
15 
Were partly smitten by fearsome apparitions
    and partly stricken by their souls’ surrender;
    for fear overwhelmed them, sudden and unexpected.
16 
Thus, then, whoever was there fell
    into that prison without bars and was kept confined.
17 
For whether one was a farmer, or a shepherd,
    or a worker at tasks in the wasteland,
Taken unawares, each served out the inescapable sentence;

    18: 
    for all were bound by the one bond of darkness.
And were it only the whistling wind,
    or the melodious song of birds in the spreading branches,
Or the steady sound of rushing water,

    19: 
    or the rude crash of overthrown rocks,
Or the unseen gallop of bounding animals,
    or the roaring cry of the fiercest beasts,
Or an echo resounding from the hollow of the hills—
    these sounds, inspiring terror, paralyzed them.

    20: 
For the whole world shone with brilliant light
    and continued its works without interruption;

    21: 
But over them alone was spread oppressive night,
    an image of the darkness that was about to come upon them.
    Yet they were more a burden to themselves than was the darkness.


  Chapter 18.

    1: 
1 
But your holy ones had very great light;
And those others, who heard their voices but did not see their forms,
    counted them blest for not having suffered;

    2: 
And because they who formerly had been wronged did not harm them, they thanked them,
    and because of the difference between them, pleaded with them.

    3: 
Instead of this, you furnished the flaming pillar,
    a guide on the unknown way,
    and the mild sun for an honorable migration.

    4: 
For they deserved to be deprived of light and imprisoned by darkness,
    they had kept your children confined,
    through whom the imperishable light of the law was to be given to the world.
Fifth Example: Death of the Egyptian Firstborn; the Israelites Are Spared

    5: 
When they determined to put to death the infants of the holy ones,
    and when a single boy had been cast forth and then saved,
As a reproof you carried off a multitude of their children
    and made them perish all at once in the mighty water.

    6: 
That night was known beforehand to our ancestors,
    so that, with sure knowledge of the oaths in which they put their faith, they might have courage.

    7: 
    8: 1 
But your holy ones had very great light;
And those others, who heard their voices but did not see their forms,
    counted them blest for not having suffered;
2

    and because of the difference between them, pleaded with them.
3

    and the mild sun for an honorable migration.
4 
[b]For they deserved to be deprived of light and imprisoned by darkness,
    they had kept your children confined,
    through whom the imperishable light of the law was to be given to the world.
Fifth Example: Death of the Egyptian Firstborn; the Israelites Are Spared
5 
When they determined to put to death the infants of the holy ones,
    and when a single boy[c] had been cast forth and then saved,
As a reproof you carried off a multitude of their children
    and made them perish all at once in the mighty water.
6 
That night was known beforehand to our ancestors,
    so that, with sure knowledge of the oaths in which they put their faith, they might have courage.
7 
The expectation of your people
    was the salvation of the righteous and the destruction of their foes.
8 
For by the same means with which you punished our adversaries,
    you glorified us whom you had summoned.

    9: For in secret the holy children of the good were offering sacrifice
    and carried out with one mind the divine institution,
So that your holy ones should share alike the same blessings and dangers,
    once they had sung the ancestral hymns of praise.

    10: 
But the discordant cry of their enemies echoed back,
    and the piteous wail of mourning for children was borne to them.

    11: 
And the slave was smitten with the same retribution as the master;
    even the commoner suffered the same as the king.

    12: 
And all alike by one common form of death
    had countless dead;
For the living were not even sufficient for the burial,
    since at a single instant their most valued offspring had been destroyed.

    13: 
For though they disbelieved at every turn on account of sorceries,
    at the destruction of the firstborn they acknowledged that this people was God’s son.

    14: 
For when peaceful stillness encompassed everything
    and the night in its swift course was half spent,

    15: 
Your all-powerful word from heaven’s royal throne
    leapt into the doomed land,

    16: 
    a fierce warrior bearing the sharp sword of your inexorable decree,
And alighted, and filled every place with death,
    and touched heaven, while standing upon the earth.

    17: 
    18: 1 
But your holy ones had very great light;
And those others, who heard their voices but did not see their forms,

14 
[f]For when peaceful stillness encompassed everything
    and the night in its swift course was half spent,
15 
Your all-powerful word from heaven’s royal throne
    leapt into the doomed land,
16 
    a fierce warrior bearing the sharp sword of your inexorable decree,
And alighted, and filled every place with death,
    and touched heaven, while standing upon the earth.
17 
Then, at once, visions in horrible dreams perturbed them
    and unexpected fears assailed them;
18 
And cast half-dead, one here, another there,
    they revealed why they were dying.

    19: 
For the dreams that disturbed them had proclaimed this beforehand,
    lest they perish unaware of why they endured such evil.

    20: 
The trial of death touched even the righteous,
    and in the desert a plague struck the multitude;
Yet not for long did the anger last.

    21: 
For the blameless man hastened to be their champion,
    bearing the weapon of his special office,
    prayer and the propitiation of incense;
He withstood the wrath and put a stop to the calamity,
    showing that he was your servant.

    22: 
He overcame the bitterness
    not by bodily strength, not by force of arms;
But by word he overcame the smiter,
    recalling the sworn covenants with their ancestors.

    23: 
For when corpses had already fallen one on another in heaps,
    he stood in the midst and checked the anger,
    and cut off its way to the living.

    24: 
For on his full-length robe was the whole world,
    and ancestral glories were carved on the four rows of stones,
    and your grandeur was on the crown upon his head.

    25: 
To these the destroyer yielded, these he feared;
    for this sole trial of anger sufficed.


  Chapter 19.

    1: 
1 
But merciless wrath assailed the wicked until the end,
    for God knew beforehand what they were yet to do:

    2: 
That though they themselves had agreed to the departure
    and had anxiously sent them on their way,
    they would regret it and pursue them.

    3: 
For while they were still engaged in funeral rites
    and mourning at the burials of the dead,
They adopted another senseless plan:
    those whom they had driven out with entreaties
    they now pursued as fugitives.

    4: 
For a compulsion appropriate to this ending drew them on,
    and made them forget what had befallen them,
That they might complete the torments of their punishment,

    5: 
    and your people might experience a glorious journey
    while those others met an extraordinary death.

    6: 
For all creation, in its several kinds, was being made over anew,
    serving your commands, that your children might be preserved unharmed.

    7: 
The cloud overshadowed their camp;
    and out of what had been water, dry land was seen emerging:
Out of the Red Sea an unimpeded road,
    and a grassy plain out of the mighty flood.

    8: 
    9:  
But merciless wrath assailed the wicked until the end,
    for God knew beforehand what they were yet to do:

[b]For all creation, in its several kinds, was being made over anew,
    serving your commands, that your children might be preserved unharmed.
7 
The cloud overshadowed their camp;
    and out of what had been water, dry land was seen emerging:
Out of the Red Sea an unimpeded road,
    and a grassy plain out of the mighty flood.
8 
Over this crossed the whole nation sheltered by your hand,
    and they beheld stupendous wonders.
9 
For they ranged about like horses,
    and leapt like lambs,
    praising you, Lord, their deliverer.

    10: 
For they were still mindful of what had happened in their sojourn:
    how instead of the young of animals the land brought forth gnats,
    and instead of fishes the river swarmed with countless frogs.

    11: 
And later they saw also a new kind of bird
    when, prompted by desire, they asked for pleasant foods;

    12: 
For to appease them quail came to them from the sea.

    13: 
And the punishments came upon the sinners
    not without forewarnings from the violence of the thunderbolts.
For they justly suffered for their own misdeeds,
    since they treated their guests with the more grievous hatred.

    14: 
For those others did not receive unfamiliar visitors,
    but these were enslaving beneficent guests.

    15: 
And not that only; but what punishment was to be theirs
    since they received strangers unwillingly!

    16: 
Yet these, after welcoming them with festivities,
    oppressed with awful toils
    those who had shared with them the same rights.

    17: 
And they were struck with blindness,
    as those others had been at the doors of the righteous man—
When, surrounded by yawning darkness,
    each sought the entrance of his own door.

    18:

17 
And they were struck with blindness,[g]
    as those others had been at the doors of the righteous man—
When, surrounded by yawning darkness,
    each sought the entrance of his own door.
18 
For the elements, in ever-changing harmony,
    like strings of the harp, produce new melody,
    while the flow of music steadily persists.
And this can be perceived exactly from a review of what took place.
19 
For land creatures were changed into water creatures,
    and those that swam went over on land.

    20: 
Fire in water maintained its own strength,
    and water forgot its quenching nature;

    21: 
Flames, by contrast, neither consumed the flesh
    of the perishable animals that went about in them,
    nor melted the icelike, quick-melting kind of ambrosial food.

    22: 
For every way, Lord! you magnified and glorified your people;
    unfailing, you stood by them in every time and circumstance.
