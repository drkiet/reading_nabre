My heart is stirred by a noble theme,
    as I sing my ode to the king.
    My tongue is the pen of a nimble scribe.
II
3 
You are the most handsome of men;
    fair speech has graced your lips,
    for God has blessed you forever.
4 
Gird your sword upon your hip, mighty warrior!
    In splendor and majesty ride on triumphant!
5 
In the cause of truth, meekness, and justice
    may your right hand show your wondrous deeds.

    6: 
Your arrows are sharp;
    peoples will cower at your feet;
    the king’s enemies will lose heart.

    7: 
Your throne, O God, stands forever;
    your royal scepter is a scepter for justice.

    8: 
You love justice and hate wrongdoing;
    therefore God, your God, has anointed you
    with the oil of gladness above your fellow kings.

    9: With myrrh, aloes, and cassia
    your robes are fragrant.
From ivory-paneled palaces
    stringed instruments bring you joy.

    10: 
Daughters of kings are your lovely wives;
    a princess arrayed in Ophir’s gold
    comes to stand at your right hand.
III

    11: 
Listen, my daughter, and understand;
    pay me careful heed.
Forget your people and your father’s house,

    12: 
    that the king might desire your beauty.
He is your lord;

    13: 
    honor him, daughter of Tyre.
Then the richest of the people
    will seek your favor with gifts.

    14: 
All glorious is the king’s daughter as she enters,
    her raiment threaded with gold;

    15: 
In embroidered apparel she is led to the king.
    The maids of her train are presented to the king.

    16: 
They are led in with glad and joyous acclaim;
    they enter the palace of the king.
IV

    17: 
The throne of your fathers your sons will have;
    you shall make them princes through all the land.

    18: 
I will make your name renowned through all generations;
    thus nations shall praise you forever.
