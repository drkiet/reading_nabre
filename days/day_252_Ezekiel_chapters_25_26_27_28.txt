Day 252:

Reading Ezekiel, chapters ['25', '26', '27', '28']:

  Chapter 25.

    1: 
    2: 
Against Ammon. 1 The word of the Lord came to me: 2 Son of man, turn toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them. 
    3: Say to the Ammonites: Hear the word of the Lord! Thus says the Lord God: Because you jeered at my sanctuary when it was desecrated, at the land of Israel when it was destroyed, and at the house of Judah when they went into exile, 
    4: 
    5: b]
Against Ammon. 1 The word of the Lord came to me: 2 Son of man, turn toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them. 3 Say to the Ammonites: Hear the word of the Lord! Thus says the Lord God: Because you jeered at my sanctuary when it was desecrated, at the land of Israel when it was destroyed, and at the house of Judah when they went into exile, 4 therefore I am giving you to people from the east[c] as a possession. They shall set up their encampments among you and pitch their tents in your midst; they shall eat your produce and drink your milk. 5 And I will turn Rabbah into a pasture for camels and all of Ammon into a grazing place for flocks. Then you shall know that I am the Lord.

    6: For thus says the Lord God: Because you rejoiced over the land of Israel with scorn in your heart, clapping your hands and stamping your feet, 
    7: therefore, see, I am stretching out my hand against you and giving you up as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and wipe you out of the lands. I will destroy you, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
Against Moab. 
    8: Thus says the Lord God: Because Moab said, “See! the house of Judah is like all the other nations,” 
    9: herefore, I am exposing the whole flank of Moab with its cities, the jewels of its land: Beth-jesimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim. 
    10: I will hand it over, along with the Ammonites, to the people from the east that it may not be remembered among the nations. 
    11: I will execute judgment upon Moab that they may know that I am the Lord.
Against Edom. 
    12: Thus says the Lord God: Because Edom took vengeance on the house of Judah and incurred terrible guilt by taking vengeance on them, 
    13: therefore thus says the Lord God: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and cut off from it human being and beast alike. I will turn it into ruins from Teman to Dedan; they shall fall by the sword. 
    14: I will put my vengeance against Edom into the hands of my people Israel; they will deal with Edom in accord with my furious anger. Thus they shall know my vengeance!—oracle of the Lord God.
Against the Philistines. 
    15: Thus says the Lord God: Because the Philistines acted vengefully and exacted vengeance with intentional malice, destroying with undying hostility, 
    16: therefore thus says the Lord God: See! I am stretching out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites and wipe out the remnant on the seacoast. 
    17: Thus I will execute great acts of vengeance on them, punishing them furiously. Then they shall know that I am the Lord, when I wreak my vengeance on them.


  Chapter 26.

    1: 
    2: 
Against the City of Tyre. 1 On the first day of the eleventh month of the eleventh year, the word of the Lord came to me:
2 
[b]Son of man, because Tyre said of Jerusalem:
“Aha! The gateway of the peoples is smashed!
    It has been turned over to me;
    I will be enriched by its ruin!”

    3: 
    therefore thus says the Lord God:
See! I am coming against you, Tyre;
    I will churn up against you many nations,
    just as the sea churns up its waves.

    4: 
They will destroy the walls of Tyre
    and tear down its towers;
I will scrape off its debris
    and leave it a bare rock.

    5: 
    6: Against the City of Tyre. 1 On the first day of the eleventh month of the eleventh year, the word of the Lord came to me:
2 
[b]Son of man, because Tyre said of Jerusalem:
“Aha! The gateway of the peoples is smashed!
    It has been turned over to me;
    I will be enriched by its ruin!”
3 
    therefore thus says the Lord God:
See! I am coming against you, Tyre;
    I will churn up against you many nations,
    just as the sea churns up its waves.
4 
They will destroy the walls of Tyre
    and tear down its towers;
I will scrape off its debris
    and leave it a bare rock.[c]
5 
It will become a place for drying nets
    in the midst of the sea.
For I have spoken—oracle of the Lord God:
    she will become plunder for the nations.
6 
Her daughter cities[d] on the mainland
    will be slaughtered by the sword;
    then they shall know that I am the Lord.

    7: 
Indeed thus says the Lord God:
I am bringing up against Tyre
    from the north, Nebuchadnezzar,
King of Babylon, king of kings,
    with horses and chariots, with cavalry,
    and a mighty horde of troops.

    8: 
Your daughter cities on the mainland
    he shall slay with the sword.
He shall build a siege wall around you,
    throw up a ramp against you,
    and raise his shields about you.

    9: He shall pound your walls with battering-rams
    and break down your towers with his axes.

    10: 
From the surging of his horses
    he will cover you with dust;
    from the noise of warhorses,
    wheels and chariots.
Your walls will shake
    when he enters your gates,
    even as one enters a city that is breached.

    11: 
With the hooves of his horses
    he will trample all your streets;
Your people he will slay by the sword;
    your mighty pillars will collapse.

    12: 
They shall plunder your wealth
    and pillage your goods;
They will tear down your walls
    and demolish your splendid houses.
Your stones, timbers, and debris
    they will cast into the sea.

    13: 
I will bring an end to the noise of your songs;
    the music of your lyres will be heard no more.

    14: 
I will turn you into bare rock,
    you will become a place for drying nets.
You shall never be rebuilt,
    for I the Lord have spoken—
    oracle of the Lord God.

    15: 
Thus says the Lord God to Tyre:
At the sound of your downfall,
    at the groaning of the wounded,
When victims are slain within you,
    will the islands not quake?

    16: 
All the princes of the sea
    will step down from their thrones,
Lay aside their robes,
    and strip off their embroidered garments.
Clothed in mourning,
    they will sit on the ground
And tremble, horror-struck
    and appalled at you.

    17: 
They will raise lament over you
    and say to you:
How you have perished,
    gone from the seas,
    Renowned City!
Once she was mighty on the sea,
    she and her inhabitants,
Those who spread their terror
    to all who dwelt nearby.

    18: 
On this, the day of your fall,
    the islands quake!
The islands in the sea
    are terrified at your passing.

    19: 
Indeed thus says the Lord God:
When I make you a ruined city
    like cities no longer inhabited,
When I churn up the deep
    and its mighty waters cover you,

    20: 
Then I will thrust you down
    with those who go down to the pit,
    to those of the bygone age;
I will make you dwell in the netherworld,
    in the everlasting ruins,
    with those who have gone down to the pit,
So you will never return
    or have a place in the land of the living.

    21: 
I will make you a horror,
    and you shall be no more;
You shall be sought for,
    but never found again—
    oracle of the Lord God.

Sank into the heart of the sea

    28: 
At the sound of your sailors’ shouts
    the waves shudder,

    29: 
Down from their ships
    come all who ply the oars;
Sailors, all the seafaring crew,
    stand on the shore.

    30: 
They raise their voices over you
    and shout their bitter cries;
They pour dust on their heads
    and cover themselves with ashes.

    31: 
For you they shave their heads bald
    and put on sackcloth;
For you they weep bitterly,
    in anguished lament.

    32: 
They raise a lament for you;
    they wail over you:
“Who was ever destroyed like Tyre
    in the midst of the sea?”

    33: 
By exporting your goods by sea
    you satisfied many peoples,
With your great wealth and merchandise
    you enriched the kings of the earth.

    34: 
Now you are wrecked in the sea,
    in the watery depths;
Your wares and all your crew
    have fallen down with you.

    35: 
All who dwell on the coastlands
    are aghast over you;
Their kings are terrified,
    their faces distorted.

    36: 
The traders among the peoples
    now hiss at you;
You have become a horror,
    you shall be no more.


  Chapter 28.

    1: 
    2: 
The Prince of Tyre. 1 The word of the Lord came to me: 2 Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre: Thus says the Lord God:
Because you are haughty of heart,
    you say, “I am a god!
I sit on a god’s throne
    in the heart of the sea!”
But you are a man, not a god;
    yet you pretend
    you are a god at heart!

    3: 
Oh yes, you are wiser than Daniel,
    nothing secret is too obscure for you!

    4: 
By your wisdom and intelligence
    you made yourself rich,
    filling your treasuries with gold and silver.

    5: 
Through your great wisdom in trading
    you heaped up riches for yourself—
    your heart is haughty because of your riches.

    6: 
    Therefore thus says the Lord God:
Because you pretend you are a god at heart,

    7: 
    8: The Prince of Tyre. 1 The word of the Lord came to me: 2 Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre: Thus says the Lord God:
Because you are haughty of heart,
    you say, “I am a god!
I sit on a god’s throne
    in the heart of the sea!”
But you are a man, not a god;
    yet you pretend
    you are a god at heart!
3 
Oh yes, you are wiser than Daniel,[b]
    nothing secret is too obscure for you!
4 
By your wisdom and intelligence
    you made yourself rich,
    filling your treasuries with gold and silver.
5 
Through your great wisdom in trading
    you heaped up riches for yourself—
    your heart is haughty because of your riches.
6 
    Therefore thus says the Lord God:
Because you pretend you are a god at heart,
7 
Therefore, I will bring against you
    strangers, the most bloodthirsty of nations.
They shall draw their swords
    against your splendid wisdom,
    and violate your radiance.
8 
They shall thrust you down into the pit:
    you shall die a violent death
    in the heart of the sea.

    9: Then, face to face with your killers,
    will you still say, “I am a god”?
No, you are a man, not a god,
    handed over to those who slay you.

    10: 
You shall die the death of the uncircumcised
    handed over to strangers,
    for I have spoken—oracle of the Lord God.

    11: The word of the Lord came to me: 
    12: Son of man, raise a lament over the king of Tyre, and say to him: Thus says the Lord God:
 You were a seal of perfection,
    full of wisdom, perfect in beauty.

    13: 
In Eden, the garden of God, you lived;
    precious stones of every kind were your covering:
Carnelian, topaz, and beryl,
    chrysolite, onyx, and jasper,
    sapphire, garnet, and emerald.
Their mounts and settings
    were wrought in gold,
    fashioned for you the day you were created.

    14: 
With a cherub I placed you;
    I put you on the holy mountain of God,
    where you walked among fiery stones.

    15: 
Blameless were you in your ways
    from the day you were created,
Until evil was found in you.

    16: 
    Your commerce was full of lawlessness, and you sinned.
Therefore I banished you from the mountain of God;
    the cherub drove you out
    from among the fiery stones.

    17: 
Your heart had grown haughty
    because of your beauty;
You corrupted your wisdom
    because of your splendor.
I cast you to the ground,
    I made you a spectacle
    in the sight of kings.

    18: 
Because of the enormity of your guilt,
    and the perversity of your trade,
    you defiled your sanctuary.
I brought fire out of you;
    it devoured you;
I made you ashes on the ground
    in the eyes of all who see you.

    19: 
All the nations who knew you
    are appalled on account of you;
You have become a horror,
    never to be again.
Against Sidon. 
    20: The word of the Lord came to me: 
    21: Son of man, turn your face toward Sidon and prophesy against it. 
    22: Thus says the Lord God:
Watch out! I am against you, Sidon;
    I will win glory for myself in your midst.
They shall know that I am the Lord,
    when I deliver judgment upon it
    and manifest my holiness in it.

    23: 
I will send disease into it;
    blood will fill its streets,
Within it shall fall
    those slain by the sword
    raised against it on every side.
Then they shall know that I am the Lord.

    24: 
No longer will there be a thorn that tears
    or a brier that scratches for the house of Israel
From the surrounding neighbors
    who despise them;
    thus they shall know that I am the Lord.

    25: Thus says the Lord God: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and I manifest my holiness through them in the sight of the nations, then they shall live on the land I gave my servant Jacob. 
    26: They shall dwell on it securely, building houses and planting vineyards. They shall dwell securely while I execute judgment on all their neighbors who treated them with contempt; then they shall know that I, the Lord, am their God.
