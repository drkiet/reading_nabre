Day 156:

Reading Psalm, chapters ['53', '54', '55', '56']:

  Chapter 53.

    1: For the leader; according to Mahalath. A maskil of David.
I

    2: 
    3: a]
A Lament over Widespread Corruption
1 For the leader; according to Mahalath. A maskil of David.
I
2 
The fool says in his heart,
    “There is no God.”
They act corruptly and practice injustice;
    there is none that does good.
3 
God looks out from the heavens
    upon the children of Adam,
To see if there is a discerning person
    who is seeking God.

    4: 
    5: 
A Lament over Widespread Corruption
1 For the leader; according to Mahalath. A maskil of David.
I
2 
The fool says in his heart,
    “There is no God.”
They act corruptly and practice injustice;
    there is none that does good.
3 
God looks out from the heavens
    upon the children of Adam,
To see if there is a discerning person
    who is seeking God.
4 
All have gone astray;
    each one is altogether perverse.
    There is not one who does what is good, not even one.
II
5 
Do they not know better, those who do evil,
    who feed upon my people as they feed upon bread?
    Have they not called upon God?

    6: 
They are going to fear his name with great fear,
    though they had not feared it before.
For God will scatter the bones
    of those encamped against you.
They will surely be put to shame,
    for God has rejected them.
III

    7: 
Who will bring forth from Zion
    the salvation of Israel?
When God reverses the captivity of his people
    Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad.


  Chapter 54.

    1: For the leader. On stringed instruments. A maskil of David, 
    2: when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, “David is hiding among us.”
I

    3: 
    4: 
    5: 
Confident Prayer in Great Peril
1 For the leader. On stringed instruments. A maskil of David, 2 when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, “David is hiding among us.”
I
3 
O God, by your name[b] save me.
    By your strength defend my cause.
4 
O God, hear my prayer.
    Listen to the words of my mouth.
5 
Strangers have risen against me;
    the ruthless seek my life;
    they do not keep God before them.
Selah
II

    6: 
God is present as my helper;
    the Lord sustains my life.

    7: 
Turn back the evil upon my foes;
    in your faithfulness, destroy them.

    8: 
Then I will offer you generous sacrifice
    and give thanks to your name, Lord, for it is good.

    9: Because it has rescued me from every trouble,
    and my eyes look down on my foes.


  Chapter 55.

    1: For the leader. On stringed instruments. A maskil of David.
I

    2: 
Listen, God, to my prayer;
    do not hide from my pleading;

    3: 
    hear me and give answer.
I rock with grief; I groan

    4: 
    5: 
A Lament over Betrayal
1 For the leader. On stringed instruments. A maskil of David.
I
2 
Listen, God, to my prayer;
    do not hide from my pleading;
3 
    hear me and give answer.
I rock with grief; I groan
4 
    at the uproar of the enemy,
    the clamor of the wicked.
They heap trouble upon me,
    savagely accuse me.
5 
My heart pounds within me;
    death’s terrors fall upon me.

    6: 
Fear and trembling overwhelm me;
    shuddering sweeps over me.

    7: 
I say, “If only I had wings like a dove
    that I might fly away and find rest.

    8: 
Far away I would flee;
    I would stay in the desert.
Selah

    9: “I would soon find a shelter
    from the raging wind and storm.”
II

    10: 
Lord, check and confuse their tongues.
    For I see violence and strife in the city

    11: 
    making rounds on its walls day and night.
Within are mischief and trouble;

    12: 
    treachery is in its midst;
    oppression and fraud never leave its streets.

    13: 
For it is not an enemy that reviled me—
    that I could bear—
Not a foe who viewed me with contempt,
    from that I could hide.

    14: 
But it was you, my other self,
    my comrade and friend,

    15: 
You, whose company I enjoyed,
    at whose side I walked
    in the house of God.
III

    16: 
Let death take them;
    let them go down alive to Sheol,
    for evil is in their homes and bellies.

    17: 
But I will call upon God,
    and the Lord will save me.

    18: 
At dusk, dawn, and noon
    I will grieve and complain,
    and my prayer will be heard.

    19: 
He will redeem my soul in peace
    from those who war against me,
    though there are many who oppose me.

    20: 
God, who sits enthroned forever,
    will hear me and afflict them.
Selah
For they will not mend their ways;
    they have no fear of God.

    21: 
He stretched out his hand at his friends
    and broke his covenant.

    22: 
Softer than butter is his speech,
    but war is in his heart.
Smoother than oil are his words,
    but they are unsheathed swords.

    23: 
Cast your care upon the Lord,
    who will give you support.
He will never allow
    the righteous to stumble.

    24: 
But you, God, will bring them down
    to the pit of destruction.
These bloodthirsty liars
    will not live half their days,
    but I put my trust in you.


  Chapter 56.

    1: For the director. According to Yonath elem rehoqim. A miktam of David, when the Philistines seized him at Gath.
I

    2: 
Have mercy on me, God,
    for I am treated harshly;
    attackers press me all the day.

    3: 
My foes treat me harshly all the day;
    yes, many are my attackers.
O Most High, 
    4: 
    5: 
    6: a]
Trust in God
1 For the director. According to Yonath elem rehoqim.[b] A miktam of David, when the Philistines seized him at Gath.
I
2 
Have mercy on me, God,
    for I am treated harshly;
    attackers press me all the day.
3 
My foes treat me harshly all the day;
    yes, many are my attackers.
O Most High, 4 when I am afraid,
    in you I place my trust.
5 
I praise the word of God;
    I trust in God, I do not fear.
    What can mere flesh do to me?
II
6 
All the day they foil my plans;
    their every thought is of evil against me.

    7: 
They hide together in ambush;
    they watch my every step;
    they lie in wait for my life.

    8: 
They are evil; watch them, God!
    Cast the nations down in your anger!

    9: My wanderings you have noted;
    are my tears not stored in your flask,
    recorded in your book?

    10: 
My foes turn back when I call on you.
    This I know: God is on my side.

    11: 
I praise the word of God,
    I praise the word of the Lord.

    12: 
In God I trust, I do not fear.
    What can man do to me?
III

    13: 
I have made vows to you, God;
    with offerings I will fulfill them,

    14: 
For you have snatched me from death,
    kept my feet from stumbling,
That I may walk before God
    in the light of the living.
