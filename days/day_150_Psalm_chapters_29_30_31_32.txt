Thanksgiving for Deliverance
1 A psalm. A song for the dedication of the Temple.[b] Of David.
I
2 
I praise you, Lord, for you raised me up
    and did not let my enemies rejoice over me.
3 
O Lord, my God,
    I cried out to you for help and you healed[c] me.

    4: 
Lord, you brought my soul up from Sheol;
    you let me live, from going down to the pit.
II

    5: 
Sing praise to the Lord, you faithful;
    give thanks to his holy memory.

    6: 
For his anger lasts but a moment;
    his favor a lifetime.
At dusk weeping comes for the night;
    but at dawn there is rejoicing.
III

    7: 
Complacent, I once said,
    “I shall never be shaken.”

    8: 
Lord, you showed me favor,
    established for me mountains of virtue.
But when you hid your face
    I was struck with terror.

    9: To you, Lord, I cried out;
    with the Lord I pleaded for mercy:

    10: 
“What gain is there from my lifeblood,
    from my going down to the grave?
Does dust give you thanks
    or declare your faithfulness?

    11: 
Hear, O Lord, have mercy on me;
    Lord, be my helper.”
IV

    12: 
You changed my mourning into dancing;
    you took off my sackcloth
    and clothed me with gladness.

    13: 
So that my glory may praise you
    and not be silent.
O Lord, my God,
    forever will I give you thanks.


  Chapter 31.

    1: a]
Prayer in Distress and Thanksgiving for Escape
1 For the leader. A psalm of David.
I

    2: 
    3: 
Prayer in Distress and Thanksgiving for Escape
1 For the leader. A psalm of David.
I
2 
In you, Lord, I take refuge;
    let me never be put to shame.
In your righteousness deliver me;
3 
    incline your ear to me;
    make haste to rescue me!
Be my rock of refuge,
    a stronghold to save me.

    4: 
For you are my rock and my fortress;
    for your name’s sake lead me and guide me.

    5: 
Free me from the net they have set for me,
    for you are my refuge.

    6: 
Into your hands I commend my spirit;
    you will redeem me, Lord, God of truth.

    7: 
You hate those who serve worthless idols,
    but I trust in the Lord.

    8: 
I will rejoice and be glad in your mercy,
    once you have seen my misery,
     gotten to know the distress of my soul.

    9: You will not abandon me into enemy hands,
    but will set my feet in a free and open space.
II

    10: 
Be gracious to me, Lord, for I am in distress;
    affliction is wearing down my eyes,
    my throat and my insides.

    11: 
My life is worn out by sorrow,
    and my years by sighing.
My strength fails in my affliction;
    my bones are wearing down.

    12: 
To all my foes I am a thing of scorn,
    and especially to my neighbors
    a horror to my friends.
When they see me in public,
    they quickly shy away.

    13: 
I am forgotten, out of mind like the dead;
    I am like a worn-out tool.

    14: 
I hear the whispers of the crowd;
    terrors are all around me.
They conspire together against me;
    they plot to take my life.

    15: 
But I trust in you, Lord;
    I say, “You are my God.”

    16: 
My destiny is in your hands;
    rescue me from my enemies,
    from the hands of my pursuers.

    17: 
Let your face shine on your servant;
    save me in your mercy.

    18: 
Do not let me be put to shame,
    for I have called to you, Lord.
Put the wicked to shame;
    reduce them to silence in Sheol.

    19: 
Strike dumb their lying lips,
    which speak arrogantly against the righteous
    in contempt and scorn.
III

    20: 
How great is your goodness, Lord,
    stored up for those who fear you.
You display it for those who trust you,
    in the sight of the children of Adam.

    21: 
You hide them in the shelter of your presence,
    safe from scheming enemies.
You conceal them in your tent,
    away from the strife of tongues.

    22: 
Blessed be the Lord,
    marvelously he showed to me
    his mercy in a fortified city.

    23: 
Though I had said in my alarm,
    “I am cut off from your eyes.”
Yet you heard my voice, my cry for mercy,
    when I pleaded with you for help.

    24: 
Love the Lord, all you who are faithful to him.
    The Lord protects the loyal,
    but repays the arrogant in full.

    25: 
Be strong and take heart,
    all who hope in the Lord.


  Chapter 32.

    1: 
    2: 
    3: 
Remission of Sin
1 Of David. A maskil.
I
Blessed is the one whose fault is removed,
    whose sin is forgiven.
2 
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes no guilt,
    in whose spirit is no deceit.
II
3 
Because I kept silent,[b] my bones wasted away;
    I groaned all day long.

    4: 
For day and night your hand was heavy upon me;
    my strength withered as in dry summer heat.
Selah

    5: 
Then I declared my sin to you;
    my guilt I did not hide.
I said, “I confess my transgression to the Lord,”
    and you took away the guilt of my sin.
Selah

    6: 
Therefore every loyal person should pray to you
    in time of distress.
Though flood waters threaten,
    they will never reach him.

    7: 
You are my shelter; you guard me from distress;
    with joyful shouts of deliverance you surround me.
Selah
III

    8: 
I will instruct you and show you the way you should walk,
    give you counsel with my eye upon you.

    9: Do not be like a horse or mule, without understanding;
    with bit and bridle their temper is curbed,
    else they will not come to you.
IV

    10: 
Many are the sorrows of the wicked one,
    but mercy surrounds the one who trusts in the Lord.

    11: 
Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous;
    exult, all you upright of heart.
