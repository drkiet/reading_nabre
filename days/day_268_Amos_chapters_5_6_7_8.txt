Day 268:

Reading Amos, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: 
Hear this word which I utter concerning you,
    this dirge, house of Israel:

    2: 
She is fallen, to rise no more,
    virgin Israel;
She lies abandoned on her land,
    with no one to raise her up.

    3: 
For thus says the Lord God
    to the house of Israel:
The city that marched out with a thousand
    shall be left with a hundred,
Another that marched out with a hundred
    shall be left with ten.

    4: 
    5: Third Summons
1 
Hear this word which I utter concerning you,
    this dirge, house of Israel:
2 
She is fallen, to rise no more,
    virgin Israel;
She lies abandoned on her land,
    with no one to raise her up.
3 
For thus says the Lord God
    to the house of Israel:
The city that marched out with a thousand
    shall be left with a hundred,
Another that marched out with a hundred
    shall be left with ten.
4 
For thus says the Lord[b]
    to the house of Israel:
Seek me, that you may live,
5 
    but do not seek Bethel;
Do not come to Gilgal,
    and do not cross over to Beer-sheba;
For Gilgal shall be led into exile
    and Bethel shall be no more.

    6: 
Seek the Lord, that you may live,
    lest he flare up against the house of Joseph[d] like a fire
    that shall consume the house of Israel, with no one to quench it.
8 
The one who made the Pleiades and Orion,
    who turns darkness into dawn,
    and darkens day into night;
Who summons the waters of the sea,
    and pours them out on the surface of the earth;
9 
Who makes destruction fall suddenly upon the stronghold
    and brings ruin upon the fortress,
    the Lord is his name.
IV. Three Woes
First Woe

    7: 
    8: 
The one who made the Pleiades and Orion,
    who turns darkness into dawn,
    and darkens day into night;
Who summons the waters of the sea,
    and pours them out on the surface of the earth;

    9: Who makes destruction fall suddenly upon the stronghold
    and brings ruin upon the fortress,
    the Lord is his name.
IV. Three Woes
First Woe
7 
Woe to those who turn justice into wormwood
    and cast righteousness to the ground,

    10: 
They hate those who reprove at the gate
    and abhor those who speak with integrity;

    11: 
Therefore, because you tax the destitute
    and exact from them levies of grain,
Though you have built houses of hewn stone,
    you shall not live in them;
Though you have planted choice vineyards,
    you shall not drink their wine.

    12: 
Yes, I know how many are your crimes,
    how grievous your sins:
Oppressing the just, accepting bribes,
    turning away the needy at the gate.

    13: 
(Therefore at this time the wise are struck dumb
    for it is an evil time.)

    14: 
Seek good and not evil,
    that you may live;
Then truly the Lord, the God of hosts,
    will be with you as you claim.

    15: 
Hate evil and love good,
    and let justice prevail at the gate;
Then it may be that the Lord, the God of hosts,
    will have pity on the remnant of Joseph.

    16: 
Therefore, thus says the Lord,
    the God of hosts, the Lord:
In every square there shall be lamentation,
    and in every street they shall cry, “Oh, no!”
They shall summon the farmers to wail
    and the professional mourners to lament.

    17: 
And in every vineyard there shall be lamentation
    when I pass through your midst, says the Lord.
Second Woe

    18: 
Woe to those who yearn
    for the day of the Lord!
What will the day of the Lord mean for you?
    It will be darkness, not light!

    19: 
As if someone fled from a lion
    and a bear met him;
Or as if on entering the house
    he rested his hand against the wall,
    and a snake bit it.

    20: 
Truly, the day of the Lord will be darkness, not light,
    gloom without any brightness!

    21: 
I hate, I despise your feasts,
    I take no pleasure in your solemnities.

    22: 
Even though you bring me your burnt offerings and grain offerings
    I will not accept them;
Your stall-fed communion offerings,
    I will not look upon them.

    23: 
Take away from me
    your noisy songs;
The melodies of your harps,
    I will not listen to them.

    24: 
Rather let justice surge like waters,
    and righteousness like an unfailing stream.

    25: 
Did you bring me sacrifices and grain offerings
    for forty years in the desert, O house of Israel?

    26: 
Yet you will carry away Sukuth, your king,
    and Kaiwan, your star-image,
    your gods that you have made for yourselves,

    27: 
As I exile you beyond Damascus,
    says the Lord,
    whose name is the God of hosts.


  Chapter 6.

    1: 
Woe to those who are complacent in Zion,
    secure on the mount of Samaria,
Leaders of the first among nations,
    to whom the people of Israel turn.

    2: 
Pass over to Calneh and see,
    go from there to Hamath the great,
    and down to Gath of the Philistines.
Are you better than these kingdoms,
    or is your territory greater than theirs?

    3: 
You who would put off the day of disaster,
    yet hasten the time of violence!

    4: 
Those who lie on beds of ivory,
    and lounge upon their couches;
Eating lambs taken from the flock,
    and calves from the stall;

    5: 
    6: Third Woe
1 
Woe to those who are complacent in Zion,
    secure on the mount of Samaria,
Leaders of the first among nations,
    to whom the people of Israel turn.
2 
Pass over to Calneh and see,
    go from there to Hamath the great,
    and down to Gath of the Philistines.
Are you better than these kingdoms,
    or is your territory greater than theirs?
3 
You who would put off the day of disaster,
    yet hasten the time of violence!
4 
Those who lie on beds of ivory,
    and lounge upon their couches;
Eating lambs taken from the flock,
    and calves from the stall;
5 
Who improvise to the music of the harp,
    composing on musical instruments like David,
6 
Who drink wine from bowls,
    and anoint themselves with the best oils,
    but are not made ill by the collapse of Joseph;

    7: 
Therefore, now they shall be the first to go into exile,
    and the carousing of those who lounged shall cease.

    8: 
The Lord God has sworn by his very self—
    an oracle of the Lord, the God of hosts:
I abhor the pride of Jacob,
    I hate his strongholds,
    and I will hand over the city with everything in it;

    9: Should there remain ten people
    in a single house, these shall die.

    10: 
When a relative or one who prepares the body picks up the remains
    to carry them out of the house,
If he says to someone in the recesses of the house,
    “Is anyone with you?” and the answer is, “No one,”
Then he shall say, “Silence!”
    for no one must mention the name of the Lord.

    11: 
Indeed, the Lord has given the command
    to shatter the great house to bits,
    and reduce the small house to rubble.

    12: 
Can horses run over rock,
    or can one plow the sea with oxen?
Yet you have turned justice into gall,
    and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,

    13: 
You who rejoice in Lodebar,
    and say, “Have we not, by our own strength,
    seized Karnaim for ourselves?”

    14: 
Look, I am raising up against you, house of Israel—
    oracle of the Lord, the God of hosts—
A nation that shall oppress you
    from Lebo-hamath even to the Wadi Arabah.


  Chapter 7.

    1: This is what the Lord God showed me: He was forming a locust swarm when the late growth began to come up (the late growth after the king’s mowing). 
    2: When they had finished eating the grass in the land, I said:
Forgive, O Lord God!
    Who will raise up Jacob?
    He is so small!

    3: The Lord relented concerning this. “This shall not be,” said the Lord God.
Second Vision: The Rain of Fire

    4: This is what the Lord God showed me: He was summoning a rain of fire. It had devoured the great abyss and was consuming the fields. 
    5: Then I said:
Cease, O Lord God!
    Who will raise up Jacob?
    He is so small!

    6: 
    7: First Vision: The Locust Swarm
1 This is what the Lord God showed me: He was forming a locust swarm when the late growth began to come up (the late growth after the king’s mowing). 2 When they had finished eating the grass in the land, I said:
Forgive, O Lord God!
    Who will raise up Jacob?
    He is so small!
3 The Lord relented concerning this. “This shall not be,” said the Lord God.
Second Vision: The Rain of Fire
4 This is what the Lord God showed me: He was summoning a rain of fire. It had devoured the great abyss and was consuming the fields. 5 Then I said:
Cease, O Lord God!
    Who will raise up Jacob?
    He is so small!
6 The Lord relented concerning this. “This also shall not be,” said the Lord God.
Third Vision: The Plummet
7 This is what the Lord God showed me: He was standing, plummet in hand, by a wall built with a plummet.[b] 
    8: The Lord God asked me, “What do you see, Amos?” And I answered, “A plummet.” Then the Lord said:
See, I am laying the plummet
    in the midst of my people Israel;
    I will forgive them no longer.

    9: The high places of Isaac shall be laid waste,
    and the sanctuaries of Israel made desolate;
    and I will attack the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
Biographical Interlude: Amos and Amaziah

    10: Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent word to Jeroboam, king of Israel: “Amos has conspired against you within the house of Israel; the country cannot endure all his words. 
    11: For this is what Amos says:
‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword,
    and Israel shall surely be exiled from its land.’”

    12: To Amos, Amaziah said: “Off with you, seer, flee to the land of Judah and there earn your bread by prophesying! 
    13: But never again prophesy in Bethel; for it is the king’s sanctuary and a royal temple.” 
    14: Amos answered Amaziah, “I am not a prophet, nor do I belong to a company of prophets. I am a herdsman and a dresser of sycamores, 
    15: but the Lord took me from following the flock, and the Lord said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’ 
    16: Now hear the word of the Lord:
You say: ‘Do not prophesy against Israel,
    do not preach against the house of Isaac.’

    17: 
Therefore thus says the Lord:
Your wife shall become a prostitute in the city,
    and your sons and daughters shall fall by the sword.
Your land shall be parcelled out by measuring line,
    and you yourself shall die in an unclean land;
    and Israel shall be exiled from its land.”


  Chapter 8.

    1: This is what the Lord God showed me: a basket of end-of-summer fruit. 
    2: He asked, “What do you see, Amos?” And I answered, “A basket of end-of-summer fruit.” And the Lord said to me:
The end has come for my people Israel;
    I will forgive them no longer.

    3: 
The temple singers will wail on that day—
    oracle of the Lord God.
Many shall be the corpses,
    strewn everywhere—Silence!

    4: 
Hear this, you who trample upon the needy
    and destroy the poor of the land:

    5: 
“When will the new moon be over,” you ask,
    “that we may sell our grain,
And the sabbath,
    that we may open the grain-bins?
We will diminish the ephah,
    add to the shekel,
    and fix our scales for cheating!

    6: 
We will buy the destitute for silver,
    and the poor for a pair of sandals;
    even the worthless grain we will sell!”

    7: 
    8: Fourth Vision: The Summer Fruit
1 This is what the Lord God showed me: a basket of end-of-summer fruit. 2 He asked, “What do you see, Amos?” And I answered, “A basket of end-of-summer fruit.” And the Lord said to me:
The end has come for my people Israel;
    I will forgive them no longer.
3 
The temple singers will wail on that day—
    oracle of the Lord God.
Many shall be the corpses,
    strewn everywhere—Silence!
4 
Hear this, you who trample upon the needy
    and destroy the poor of the land:
5 
“When will the new moon be over,” you ask,
    “that we may sell our grain,
And the sabbath,
    that we may open the grain-bins?
We will diminish the ephah,[b]
    add to the shekel,
    and fix our scales for cheating!
6 
We will buy the destitute for silver,
    and the poor for a pair of sandals;
    even the worthless grain we will sell!”
7 
The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob:
    Never will I forget a thing they have done!
8 
Shall not the land tremble because of this,
    and all who dwell in it mourn?
It will all rise up and toss like the Nile,
    and subside like the river of Egypt.

    9: On that day—oracle of the Lord God—
    I will make the sun set at midday
    and in broad daylight cover the land with darkness.

    10: 
I will turn your feasts into mourning
    and all your songs into dirges.
I will cover the loins of all with sackcloth
    and make every head bald.
I will make it like the time of mourning for an only child,
    and its outcome like a day of bitter weeping.

    11: 
See, days are coming—oracle of the Lord God—
    when I will send a famine upon the land:
Not a hunger for bread, or a thirst for water,
    but for hearing the word of the Lord.

    12: 
They shall stagger from sea to sea
    and wander from north to east
In search of the word of the Lord,
    but they shall not find it.

    13: 
On that day, beautiful young women and young men
    shall faint from thirst,

    14: 
Those who swear by Ashima of Samaria,
    and who say, “By the life of your god, O Dan,”
“By the life of the Power of Beer-sheba!”
    They shall fall, never to rise again.


End of day 268.
