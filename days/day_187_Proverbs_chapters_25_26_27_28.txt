Day 187:

Reading Proverbs, chapters ['25', '26', '27', '28']:

  Chapter 25.

    1: 
    2: 
1 These also are proverbs of Solomon. The servants of Hezekiah, king of Judah, transmitted them.
2 
[c]It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,
    and the glory of kings to fathom a matter.[d]

    3: 
Like the heavens in height, and the earth in depth,
    the heart of kings is unfathomable.

    4: 
    5: 1 These also are proverbs of Solomon. The servants of Hezekiah, king of Judah, transmitted them.
2 
[c]It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,
    and the glory of kings to fathom a matter.[d]
3 
Like the heavens in height, and the earth in depth,
    the heart of kings is unfathomable.
4 
[e]Remove the dross from silver,
    and it comes forth perfectly purified;
5 
Remove the wicked from the presence of the king,
    and his throne is made firm through justice.

    6: 
Claim no honor in the king’s presence,
    nor occupy the place of superiors;

    7: 
For it is better to be told, “Come up closer!”
    than to be humbled before the prince.

    8: 
What your eyes have seen
    do not bring forth too quickly against an opponent;
For what will you do later on
    when your neighbor puts you to shame?

    9: Argue your own case with your neighbor,
    but the secrets of others do not disclose;

    10: 
Lest, hearing it, they reproach you,
    and your ill repute never ceases.

    11: 
Golden apples in silver settings
    are words spoken at the proper time.

    12: 
A golden earring or a necklace of fine gold—
    one who gives wise reproof to a listening ear.

    13: 
Like the coolness of snow in the heat of the harvest
    are faithful messengers for those who send them,
    lifting the spirits of their masters.

    14: 
Clouds and wind but no rain—
    the one who boasts of a gift not given.

    15: 
By patience is a ruler persuaded,
    and a soft tongue can break a bone.

    16: 
If you find honey, eat only what you need,
    lest you have your fill and vomit it up.

    17: 
Let your foot be seldom in your neighbors’ house,
    lest they have their fill of you—and hate you.

    18: 
A club, sword, or sharp arrow—
    the one who bears false witness against a neighbor.

    19: 
A bad tooth or an unsteady foot—
    a trust betrayed in time of trouble.

    20: 
Like the removal of clothes on a cold day, or vinegar on soda,
    is the one who sings to a troubled heart.

    21: 
If your enemies are hungry, give them food to eat,
    if thirsty, give something to drink;

    22: 
For live coals you will heap on their heads,
    and the Lord will vindicate you.

    23: 
The north wind brings rain,
    and a backbiting tongue, angry looks.

    24: 
    25: 1 These also are proverbs of Solomon. The servants of Hezekiah, king of Judah, transmitted them.

7 
For it is better to be told, “Come up closer!”
    than to be humbled before the prince.
8 
What your eyes have seen
    do not bring forth too quickly against an opponent;
For what will you do later on
    when your neighbor puts you to shame?
9 
[g]Argue your own case with your neighbor,
    but the secrets of others do not disclose;
10 
Lest, hearing it, they reproach you,
    and your ill repute never ceases.

    is the one who sings to a troubled heart.
21 
[j]If your enemies are hungry, give them food to eat,
    if thirsty, give something to drink;
22 
For live coals you will heap on their heads,
    and the Lord will vindicate you.
23 
The north wind brings rain,
    and a backbiting tongue, angry looks.
24 
It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop
    than in a mansion with a quarrelsome wife.[k]
25 
Cool water to one faint from thirst
    is good news from a far country.

    26: 
A trampled fountain or a polluted spring—
    a just person fallen before the wicked.

    27: 
To eat too much honey is not good;
    nor to seek honor after honor.

    28: 
A city breached and left defenseless
    are those who do not control their temper.


  Chapter 26.

    1: 
    2: 
1 
Like snow in summer, like rain in harvest,
    honor for a fool is out of place.[b]
2 
Like the sparrow in its flitting, like the swallow in its flight,
    a curse uncalled-for never lands.[c]

    3: 
The whip for the horse, the bridle for the ass,
    and the rod for the back of fools.

Do not answer fools according to their folly,
    lest you too become like them.

5 
Answer fools according to their folly,
    lest they become wise in their own eyes.
6 
Those who send messages by a fool
    cut off their feet; they drink down violence.

    7: 
A proverb in the mouth of a fool
    hangs limp, like crippled legs.

    8: 
Giving honor to a fool

    9: A thorn stuck in the hand of a drunkard
    is a proverb in the mouth of fools.

An archer wounding all who pass by
    is anyone who hires a drunken fool.

    There is more hope for fools than for them.

    13: 
The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the street,
    a lion in the middle of the square!”

    14: 
The door turns on its hinges
    and sluggards, on their beds.

    15: 
The sluggard buries a hand in the dish,
    too weary to lift it to the mouth.

    16: 
In their own eyes sluggards are wiser
    than seven who answer with good judgment.

    17: 
Whoever meddles in the quarrel of another
    is one who grabs a passing dog by the ears.

    18: 
Like a crazed archer
    scattering firebrands and deadly arrows,

    19: 
Such are those who deceive their neighbor,
    and then say, “I was only joking.”

    20: 
Without wood the fire dies out;
    without a talebearer strife subsides.

    21: 
Charcoal for coals, wood for fire—
    such are the quarrelsome, enkindling strife.

    22: 
The words of a talebearer are like dainty morsels:
    they sink into one’s inmost being.

    23: 
Like a glazed finish on earthenware
    are smooth lips and a wicked heart.

    24: 
With their lips enemies pretend,

The words of a talebearer are like dainty morsels:
    they sink into one’s inmost being.[h]
23 
Like a glazed finish on earthenware
    are smooth lips and a wicked heart.[i]
24 
With their lips enemies pretend,
    but inwardly they maintain deceit;
25 
When they speak graciously, do not trust them,
    for seven abominations[j] are in their hearts.
26 
Hatred can be concealed by pretense,
    but malice will be revealed in the assembly.[k]

    27: 
Whoever digs a pit falls into it;
    and a stone comes back upon the one who rolls it.

    28: 
The lying tongue is its owner’s enemy,
    and the flattering mouth works ruin.


  Chapter 27.

    1: 
    2: 
1 
Do not boast about tomorrow,
    for you do not know what any day may bring forth.
2 
Let another praise you, not your own mouth;
    a stranger, not your own lips.

    3: 
Stone is heavy, and sand a burden,
    but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.

    4: 
Anger is cruel, and wrath overwhelming,
    but before jealousy who can stand?

    5: 
Better is an open rebuke
    than a love that remains hidden.

    6: 
    7: 1

5 
[b]Better is an open rebuke
    than a love that remains hidden.
6 
Trustworthy are the blows of a friend,
    dangerous, the kisses of an enemy.[c]
7 
One who is full spurns honey;
    but to the hungry, any bitter thing is sweet.

    8: 
Like a bird far from the nest
    so is anyone far from home.

    9: Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart,
    but by grief the soul is torn asunder.

    10: 
Do not give up your own friend and your father’s friend;
    do not resort to the house of your kindred when trouble strikes.
Better a neighbor near than kin far away.

    11: 
Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart,
    so that I can answer whoever taunts me.

    12: 
The astute see an evil and hide;
    the naive continue on and pay the penalty.

    13: 
Take the garment of the one who became surety for a stranger;
    if for a foreign woman, exact the pledge!

    14: 
Those who greet their neighbor with a loud voice in the early morning,
    a curse can be laid to their charge.

    15: 
For a persistent leak on a rainy day
    the match is a quarrelsome wife;

    16: 
Whoever would hide her hides a stormwind
    and cannot tell north from south.

    17: 
Iron is sharpened by iron;
    one person sharpens another.

    18: 
Those who tend a fig tree eat its fruit;
    so those attentive to their master will be honored.

    19: 
As face mirrors face in water,
    so the heart reflects the person.

    20: 
Sheol and Abaddon can never be satisfied;
    so the eyes of mortals can never be satisfied.

    21: 
The crucible for silver, the furnace for gold,
    so you must assay the praise you receive.

    22: 
Though you pound fools with a pestle,
    their folly never leaves them.

    23: 
Take good care of your flocks,
    give careful attention to your herds;

    24: 
For wealth does not last forever,
    nor even a crown from age to age.

    25: 
When the grass comes up and the new growth appears,
    and the mountain greens are gathered in,

    26: 
    27: 1 
Do not boast about tomorrow,
    for you do not know what any day may bring forth.
2 
Let another praise you, not your own mouth;
    a stranger, not your own lips.

    so that I can answer whoever taunts me.[f]
12

Though you pound fools with a pestle,
    their folly never leaves them.
23 
[k]Take good care of your flocks,
    give careful attention to your herds;
24 
For wealth does not last forever,
    nor even a crown from age to age.
25 
When the grass comes up and the new growth appears,
    and the mountain greens are gathered in,
26 
The lambs will provide you with clothing,
    and the goats, the price of a field,
27 
And there will be ample goat’s milk for your food,
    food for your house, sustenance for your maidens.


  Chapter 28.

    1: 
    2: 
1 
The wicked flee though none pursue;
    but the just, like a lion, are confident.
2 
If a land is rebellious, its princes will be many;
    but with an intelligent and wise ruler there is stability.

    3: 
One who is poor and extorts from the lowly
    is a devastating rain that leaves no food.

    let no one offer support.

    18: 
Whoever walks blamelessly is safe,
    but one whose ways are crooked falls into a pit.

    19: 
Those who cultivate their land will have plenty of food,

The trustworthy will be richly blessed;
    but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished.

Misers hurry toward wealth,
    not knowing that want is coming toward them.

When the wicked prevail, people hide;
    but at their fall the just abound.
