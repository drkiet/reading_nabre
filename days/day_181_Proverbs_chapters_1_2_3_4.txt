Day 181:

Reading Proverbs, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: Purpose of the Proverbs of Solomon
1 
The proverbs[b] of Solomon, the son of David,
    king of Israel:

    2: 
That people may know wisdom and discipline,
    may understand intelligent sayings;

    3: 
May receive instruction in wise conduct,
    in what is right, just and fair;

    4: 
That resourcefulness may be imparted to the naive,
    knowledge and discretion to the young.

    5: 
The wise by hearing them will advance in learning,
    the intelligent will gain sound guidance,

    6: 
To comprehend proverb and byword,
    the words of the wise and their riddles.

    7: 
Fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge;
    fools despise wisdom and discipline.
II. Instructions of Parents and of Woman Wisdom
The Path of the Wicked: Greed and Violence[f]

    8: 
Hear, my son, your father’s instruction,
    and reject not your mother’s teaching;

    9: A graceful diadem will they be for your head;
    a pendant for your neck.

    10: 
My son, should sinners entice you,

    11: 
    do not go if they say, “Come along with us!
Let us lie in wait for blood,
    unprovoked, let us trap the innocent;

    12: 
Let us swallow them alive, like Sheol,
    whole, like those who go down to the pit!

    13: 
All kinds of precious wealth shall we gain,
    we shall fill our houses with booty;

    14: 
Cast in your lot with us,
    we shall all have one purse!”

    15: 
My son, do not walk in the way with them,
    hold back your foot from their path!

    16: 


    17: 
In vain a net is spread
    right under the eyes of any bird—

    18: 
They lie in wait for their own blood,
    they set a trap for their own lives.

    19: 
This is the way of everyone greedy for loot:
    it takes away their lives.
Wisdom in Person Gives a Warning

    20: 
Wisdom cries aloud in the street,
    in the open squares she raises her voice;

    21: 
Down the crowded ways she calls out,
    at the city gates she utters her words:

    22: 
“How long, you naive ones, will you love naivete,

    23: 
    How long will you turn away at my reproof?

    Lo! I will pour out to you my spirit,
    I will acquaint you with my words:

    24: 
‘Because I called and you refused,
    extended my hand and no one took notice;

    25: 
Because you disdained all my counsel,
    and my reproof you ignored—

    26: 
I, in my turn, will laugh at your doom;
    will mock when terror overtakes you;

    27: 
When terror comes upon you like a storm,
    and your doom approaches like a whirlwind;
    when distress and anguish befall you.’

    28: 
Then they will call me, but I will not answer;
    they will seek me, but will not find me,

    29: 
Because they hated knowledge,
    and the fear of the Lord they did not choose.

    30: 
They ignored my counsel,
    they spurned all my reproof;

    31: 
Well, then, they shall eat the fruit of their own way,
    and with their own devices be glutted.

    32: 
For the straying of the naive kills them,
    the smugness of fools destroys them.

    33: 
But whoever obeys me dwells in security,
    in peace, without fear of harm.”


  Chapter 2.

    1: 
    2: The Blessings of Wisdom
1 
My son, if you receive my words
    and treasure my commands,
2 
Turning your ear to wisdom,[b]
    inclining your heart to understanding;

    3: 
Yes, if you call for intelligence,
    and to understanding raise your voice;

    4: 
If you seek her like silver,
    and like hidden treasures search her out,

    5: 
Then will you understand the fear of the Lord;
    the knowledge of God you will find;

    6: 
For the Lord gives wisdom,
    from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;

    7: 
He has success in store for the upright,
    is the shield of those who walk honestly,

    8: 
Guarding the paths of justice,
    protecting the way of his faithful ones,

    9: Then you will understand what is right and just,
    what is fair, every good path;

    10: 
For wisdom will enter your heart,
    knowledge will be at home in your soul,

    11: 
Discretion will watch over you,
    understanding will guard you;

    12: 
Saving you from the way of the wicked,
    from those whose speech is perverse.

    13: 
From those who have left the straight paths
    to walk in the ways of darkness,

    14: 
Who delight in doing evil
    and celebrate perversity;

    15: 
Whose ways are crooked,
    whose paths are devious;

    16: 
Saving you from a stranger,
    from a foreign woman with her smooth words,

    17: 
One who forsakes the companion of her youth
    and forgets the covenant of her God;

    18: 
For her path sinks down to death,
    and her footsteps lead to the shades.

    19: 
None who enter there come back,
    or gain the paths of life.

    20: 
Thus you may walk in the way of the good,
    and keep to the paths of the just.

    21: 
For the upright will dwell in the land,
    people of integrity will remain in it;

    22: 
But the wicked will be cut off from the land,
    the faithless will be rooted out of it.


  Chapter 3.

    1: 
My son, do not forget my teaching,
    take to heart my commands;

    2: 
    3: Confidence in God Leads to Prosperity
1 
My son, do not forget[b] my teaching,
    take to heart my commands;
2 
For many days, and years of life,
    and peace, will they bring you.
3 
Do not let love and fidelity forsake you;
    bind them around your neck;
    write them on the tablet of your heart.

    4: 
Then will you win favor and esteem
    before God and human beings.

    5: 
Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
    on your own intelligence do not rely;

    6: 
In all your ways be mindful of him,
    and he will make straight your paths.

    7: 
Do not be wise in your own eyes,
    fear the Lord and turn away from evil;

    8: 
This will mean health for your flesh
    and vigor for your bones.

    9: Honor the Lord with your wealth,
    with first fruits of all your produce;

    10: 
Then will your barns be filled with plenty,
    with new wine your vats will overflow.

    11: 
The discipline of the Lord, my son, do not spurn;
    do not disdain his reproof;

    12: 
For whom the Lord loves he reproves,
    as a father, the son he favors.
The Benefits of Finding Wisdom[d]

    13: 
Happy the one who finds wisdom,
    the one who gains understanding!

    14: 
Her profit is better than profit in silver,
    and better than gold is her revenue;

    15: 
She is more precious than corals,
    and no treasure of yours can compare with her.

    16: 
Long life is in her right hand,
    in her left are riches and honor;

    17: 
Her ways are pleasant ways,
    and all her paths are peace;

    18: 
She is a tree of life to those who grasp her,
    and those who hold her fast are happy.

    19: 
The Lord by wisdom founded the earth,
    established the heavens by understanding;

    20: 
By his knowledge the depths are split,
    and the clouds drop down dew.
Justice Toward One’s Neighbor Brings Blessing[g]

    21: 
My son, do not let these slip from your sight:
    hold to deliberation and planning;

    22: 
So will they be life to your soul,
    and an adornment for your neck.

    23: 
Then you may go your way securely;
    your foot will never stumble;

    24: 
When you lie down, you will not be afraid,
    when you rest, your sleep will be sweet.

    25: 
Do not be afraid of sudden terror,
    of the ruin of the wicked when it comes;

    26: 
For the Lord will be your confidence,
    and will keep your foot from the snare.

    27: 
Do not withhold any goods from the owner
    when it is in your power to act.

    28: 
Say not to your neighbor, “Go, come back tomorrow,
    and I will give it to you,” when all the while you have it.

    29: 
Do not plot evil against your neighbors,
    when they live at peace with you.

    30: 
Do not contend with someone without cause,
    with one who has done you no harm.

    31: 
Do not envy the violent
    and choose none of their ways:

    32: 
To the Lord the devious are an abomination,
    but the upright are close to him.

    33: 
The curse of the Lord is on the house of the wicked,
    but the dwelling of the just he blesses;

    34: 
Those who scoff, he scoffs at,
    but the lowly he favors.

    35: 
The wise will possess glory,
    but fools will bear shame.


  Chapter 4.

    1: 
Hear, O children, a father’s instruction,
    be attentive, that you may gain understanding!

    2: 
Yes, excellent advice I give you;
    my teaching do not forsake.

    3: 
    4: The Teacher as Model Disciple
1 
Hear, O children, a father’s instruction,
    be attentive, that you may gain understanding!
2 
Yes, excellent advice I give you;
    my teaching do not forsake.
3 
When I was my father’s child,
    tender, the darling of my mother,
4 
He taught me and said to me:
    “Let your heart hold fast my words:
    keep my commands, and live!

    5: 
Get wisdom, get understanding!
    Do not forget or turn aside from the words of my mouth.

    6: 
Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you;
    love her, and she will safeguard you;

    7: 
The beginning of wisdom is: get wisdom;
    whatever else you get, get understanding.

    8: 
Extol her, and she will exalt you;
    she will bring you honors if you embrace her;

    9: She will put on your head a graceful diadem;
    a glorious crown will she bestow on you.”
The Two Ways

    10: 
Hear, my son, and receive my words,
    and the years of your life shall be many.

    11: 
On the way of wisdom I direct you,
    I lead you on straight paths.

    12: 
When you walk, your step will not be impeded,
    and should you run, you will not stumble.

    13: 
Hold fast to instruction, never let it go;
    keep it, for it is your life.

    14: 
The path of the wicked do not enter,
    nor walk in the way of the evil;

    15: 
Shun it, do not cross it,
    turn aside from it, pass on.

    16: 
For they cannot rest unless they have done evil;
    if they do not trip anyone they lose sleep.

    17: 
For they eat the bread of wickedness
    and drink the wine of violence.

    18: 
But the path of the just is like shining light,
    that grows in brilliance till perfect day.

    19: 
The way of the wicked is like darkness;
    they do not know on what they stumble.
With Your Whole Being Heed My Words and Live

    20: 
My son, to my words be attentive,
    to my sayings incline your ear;

    21: 
Let them not slip from your sight,
    keep them within your heart;

    22: 
For they are life to those who find them,
    bringing health to one’s whole being.

    23: 
With all vigilance guard your heart,
    for in it are the sources of life.

    24: 
Dishonest mouth put away from you,
    deceitful lips put far from you.

    25: 
Let your eyes look straight ahead
    and your gaze be focused forward.

    26: 
Survey the path for your feet,
    and all your ways will be sure.

    27: 
Turn neither to right nor to left,
    keep your foot far from evil.
