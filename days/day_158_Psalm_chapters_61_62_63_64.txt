    10: 
Mortals are a mere breath,
    the sons of man but an illusion;
On a balance they rise;
    together they weigh nothing.

    11: 
Do not trust in extortion;
    in plunder put no empty hope.
On wealth that increases,
    do not set your heart.

    12: 
One thing God has said;
    two things I have heard:
Strength belongs to God;

    13: 
    so too, my Lord, does mercy,
For you repay each man
    according to his deeds.

    to see your power and glory.
