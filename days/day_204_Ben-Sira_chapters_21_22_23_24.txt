Day 204:

Reading Ben-Sira, chapters ['21', '22', '23', '24']:

  Chapter 21.

    1: 
    2: 
Dangers from Sin
1 
My child, if you have sinned, do so no more,
    and for your past sins pray to be forgiven.
2 
Flee from sin as from a serpent
    that will bite you if you go near it;
Its teeth, lion’s teeth,
    destroying human lives.

    3: 
All lawlessness is like a two-edged sword;
    when it cuts, there is no healing.

    4: 
Panic and pride wipe out wealth;
    so too the house of the proud is uprooted.

    5: 
Prayer from the lips of the poor is heard at once,
    and justice is quickly granted them.

    6: 
Whoever hates correction walks the sinner’s path,
    but whoever fears the Lord repents in his heart.

    7: 
Glib speakers are widely known,
    but when they slip the sensible perceive it.

    8: 
Those who build their houses with someone else’s money
    are like those who collect stones for their funeral mounds.

    9: A band of criminals is like a bundle of tow;
    they will end in a flaming fire.

    10: 
The path of sinners is smooth stones,
    but its end is the pit of Sheol.
The Wise and Foolish: A Contrast[c]

    11: 
Those who keep the Law control their thoughts;
    perfect fear of the Lord is wisdom.

    12: 
One who is not clever can never be taught,
    but there is a cleverness filled with bitterness.

    13: 
The knowledge of the wise wells up like a flood,
    and their counsel like a living spring.

    14: 
A fool’s mind is like a broken jar:
    it cannot hold any knowledge at all.

    15: 
When the intelligent hear a wise saying,
    they praise it and add to it.
The wanton hear it with distaste
    and cast it behind their back.

    16: 
A fool’s chatter is like a load on a journey,
    but delight is to be found on the lips of the intelligent.

    17: 
The views of the prudent are sought in an assembly,
    and their words are taken to heart.

    18: 
Like a house in ruins is wisdom to a fool;
    to the stupid, knowledge is incomprehensible chatter.

    19: 
To the senseless, education is fetters on the feet,
    like manacles on the right hand.

    20: 
    21: Dangers from Sin
1 
My child, if you have sinned, do so no more,

    to the stupid, knowledge is incomprehensible chatter.
19 
To the senseless, education is fetters on the feet,
    like manacles on the right hand.
20 
Fools raise their voice in laughter,
    but the prudent at most smile quietly.
21 
Like a gold ornament is education to the wise,
    like a bracelet on the right arm.

    22: 
A fool steps boldly into a house,
    while the well-bred are slow to make an entrance.

    23: 
A boor peeps through the doorway of a house,
    but the educated stay outside.

    24: 
It is rude for one to listen at a door;
    the discreet person would be overwhelmed by the disgrace.

    25: 
The lips of the arrogant talk of what is not their concern,
    but the discreet carefully weigh their words.

    26: 
The mind of fools is in their mouths,
    but the mouth of the wise is in their mind.

    27: 
When the godless curse their adversary,
    they really curse themselves.

    28: 
Slanderers sully themselves,
    and are hated by their neighbors.


  Chapter 22.

    1: 
    2: 
On Laziness and Foolishness
1 
The sluggard is like a filthy stone;[b]
    everyone hisses at his disgrace.
2 
The sluggard is like a lump of dung;
    whoever touches it shakes it off the hands.

    3: 
An undisciplined child is a disgrace to its father;
    if it be a daughter, she brings him to poverty.

    4: 
A thoughtful daughter obtains a husband of her own;
    a shameless one is her father’s grief.

    5: 
A hussy shames her father and her husband;
    she is despised by both.

    6: 
Like music at the time of mourning is ill-timed talk,
    but lashes and discipline are at all times wisdom.[d]
9 
Teaching a fool is like gluing a broken pot,
    or rousing another from deep sleep.
10 
Whoever talks with a fool talks to someone asleep;
    when it is over, he says, “What was that?”
11 
Weep over the dead, for their light has gone out;
    weep over the fool, for sense has left him.
Weep but less bitterly over the dead, for they are at rest;
    worse than death is the life of a fool.
12 
Mourning for the dead, seven days—
    but for the wicked fool, a whole lifetime.
13 
Do not talk much with the stupid,
    or visit the unintelligent.
Beware of them lest you have trouble
    and be spattered when they shake themselves off.
Avoid them and you will find rest
    and not be wearied by their lack of sense.
14 
What is heavier than lead?
    What is its name but “Fool”?
15 
Sand, salt, and an iron weight
    are easier to bear than the stupid person.
16 
A wooden beam firmly bonded into a building[e]
    is not loosened by an earthquake;
So the mind firmly resolved after careful deliberation
    will not be afraid at any time.

    7: 
The mind solidly backed by intelligent thought
    is like a stucco decoration on a smooth wall.

    will not be afraid at any time.

    17: 
The mind solidly backed by intelligent thought
    is like a stucco decoration on a smooth wall.

    18: 
Small stones lying on an open height
    will not remain when the wind blows;
So a timid mind based on foolish plans
    cannot stand up to fear of any kind.
The Preservation of Friendship

    19: 
Whoever jabs the eye brings tears;
    whoever pierces the heart bares its feelings.

    20: 
Whoever throws a stone at birds drives them away;
    whoever insults a friend breaks up the friendship.

17

18 
Small stones lying on an open height
    will not remain when the wind blows;
So a timid mind based on foolish plans
    cannot stand up to fear of any kind.
The Preservation of Friendship[f]
19 
Whoever jabs the eye brings tears;
    whoever pierces the heart bares its feelings.
20 
Whoever throws a stone at birds drives them away;
    whoever insults a friend breaks up the friendship.
21 
Should you draw a sword against a friend,
    do not despair, for it can be undone.
22 
Should you open your mouth against a friend,
    do not worry, for you can be reconciled.
But a contemptuous insult, a confidence broken,
    or a treacherous attack will drive any friend away.

    23: 
Win your neighbor’s trust while he is poor,
    so that you may rejoice with him in his prosperity.
In time of trouble remain true to him,
    so that you may share in his inheritance when it comes.

    24: 
The billowing smoke of a furnace precedes the fire,
    so insults precede bloodshed.

    25: 
I am not ashamed to shelter a friend,
    and I will not hide from him.

    26: 
But if harm should come to me because of him,
    all who hear of it will beware of him.
Prayer

    27: 
Who will set a guard over my mouth,
    an effective seal on my lips,
That I may not fail through them,
    and my tongue may not destroy me?


  Chapter 23.

    1: 
    2: 
    3: 1 
Lord, Father and Master of my life,
    do not abandon me to their designs,
    do not let me fall because of them!
2 
Who will apply the lash to my thoughts,
    and to my mind the rod of discipline,
That my failings may not be spared
    or the sins of my heart overlooked?
3 
Otherwise my failings may increase,
    and my sins be multiplied;
And I fall before my adversaries,
    and my enemy rejoice over me?

    4: 
Lord, Father and God of my life,
    do not give me haughty eyes;

    5: 
    remove evil desire from my heart.

    6: 
Let neither gluttony nor lust overcome me;
    do not give me up to shameless desires.
Proper Use of the Tongue

    7: 
Listen, my children, to instruction concerning the mouth,
    for whoever keeps it will not be ensnared.

    8: 
Through the lips the sinner is caught;
    by them the reviler and the arrogant are tripped up.

    9: Do not accustom your mouth to oaths,
    or habitually utter the Holy Name.

    10: 
Just as a servant constantly under scrutiny
    will not be without bruises,
So one who swears continually by the Holy Name
    will never remain free from sin.

    11: 
Those who swear many oaths heap up offenses;
    and the scourge will never be far from their houses.
If they swear in error, guilt is incurred;
    if they neglect their obligation, the sin is doubly great.
If they swear without reason they cannot be declared innocent,
    for their households will be filled with calamities.

    12: 
There are words comparable to death;
    may they never be heard in the inheritance of Jacob.
To the devout all such words are foreign;
    they do not wallow in sin.

    13: 
Do not accustom your mouth to coarse talk,
    for it involves sinful speech.

    14: 
Keep your father and mother in mind
    when you sit among the mighty,
Lest you forget yourself in their presence
    and disgrace your upbringing.
Then you will wish you had never been born
    and will curse the day of your birth.

    15: 
Those accustomed to using abusive language
    will never acquire discipline as long as they live.
Sins of the Flesh

    16: 
Two types of people multiply sins,
    and a third draws down wrath:
Burning passion is like a blazing fire,
    not to be quenched till it burns itself out;
One unchaste with his kindred
    never stops until fire breaks forth.

    17: 
To the unchaste all bread is sweet;
    he is never through till he dies.

    18: 
The man who dishonors his marriage bed
    says to himself, “Who can see me?
Darkness surrounds me, walls hide me,
    no one sees me. Who can stop me from sinning?”
He is not mindful of the Most High,

    19: 
    fearing only human eyes.
He does not realize that the eyes of the Lord,
    ten thousand times brighter than the sun,
Observe every step taken
    and peer into hidden corners.

    20: 
The one who knows all things before they exist
    still knows them all after they are made.

    21: 
Such a man will be denounced in the streets of the city;
    and where he least suspects it, he will be apprehended.

    22: 
    23: 1 
Lord, Father and Master of my life,
    do not abandon me to their designs,
    do not let me fall because of them!
2 
Who will apply the lash to my thoughts,
    and to my mind the rod of discipline,
That my failings may not be spared
    or the sins of my heart overlooked?
3 
Otherwise my failings may increase,
    and my sins be multiplied;
And I fall before my adversaries,
    and my enemy rejoice over me?
4 
Lord, Father and God of my life,
    do not give me haughty eyes;
5 
    remove evil desire from my heart.
6 
Let neither gluttony nor lust overcome me;
    do not give me up to shameless desires.
Proper Use of the Tongue[b]
7 
Listen, my children, to instruction concerning the mouth,
    for whoever keeps it will not be ensnared.
8 
Through the lips the sinner is caught;
    by them the reviler and the arrogant are tripped up.
9 
Do not accustom your mouth to oaths,
    or habitually utter the Holy Name.
10 
Just as a servant constantly under scrutiny
    will not be without bruises,
So one who swears continually by the Holy Name
    will never remain free from sin.
11 
Those who swear many oaths heap up offenses;
    and the scourge will never be far from their houses.
If they swear in error, guilt is incurred;
    if they neglect their obligation, the sin is doubly great.
If they swear without reason they cannot be declared innocent,
    for their households will be filled with calamities.
12 
There are words comparable to death;
    may they never be heard in the inheritance of Jacob.
To the devout all such words are foreign;
    they do not wallow in sin.
13 
Do not accustom your mouth to coarse talk,
    for it involves sinful speech.
14 
Keep your father and mother in mind
    when you sit among the mighty,
Lest you forget yourself in their presence
    and disgrace your upbringing.
Then you will wish you had never been born
    and will curse the day of your birth.
15 
Those accustomed to using abusive language
    will never acquire discipline as long as they live.
Sins of the Flesh[c]
16 
Two types of people multiply sins,
    and a third[d] draws down wrath:
Burning passion is like a blazing fire,
    not to be quenched till it burns itself out;
One unchaste with his kindred
    never stops until fire breaks forth.
17 
To the unchaste all bread is sweet;
    he is never through till he dies.
18 
The man who dishonors his marriage bed
    says to himself, “Who can see me?
Darkness surrounds me, walls hide me,
    no one sees me. Who can stop me from sinning?”
He is not mindful of the Most High,
19 
    fearing only human eyes.
He does not realize that the eyes of the Lord,
    ten thousand times brighter than the sun,
Observe every step taken
    and peer into hidden corners.
20 
The one who knows all things before they exist
    still knows them all after they are made.
21 
Such a man will be denounced in the streets of the city;
    and where he least suspects it, he will be apprehended.
22 
So it is with the woman unfaithful to her husband,
    who offers him an heir by another man.
23 
First of all, she has disobeyed the law of the Most High;
    second, she has wronged her husband;
Third, through her wanton adultery
    she has brought forth children by another man.

    24: 
Such a woman will be dragged before the assembly,
    and her punishment will extend to her children.

    25: 
Her children will not take root;
    her branches will not bring forth fruit.

    26: 
She will leave behind an accursed memory;
    her disgrace will never be blotted out.

    27: 
Thus all who dwell on the earth shall know,
    all who remain in the world shall understand,
That nothing is better than the fear of the Lord,
    nothing sweeter than obeying the commandments of the Lord.


  Chapter 24.

    1: 
    2: 
Praise of Wisdom
1 
Wisdom sings her own praises,
    among her own people she proclaims her glory.
2 
In the assembly of the Most High she opens her mouth,
    in the presence of his host she tells of her glory:

    3: 
    4: Praise of Wisdom
1 
Wisdom sings her own praises,
    among her own people she proclaims her glory.
2 
In the assembly of the Most High she opens her mouth,
    in the presence of his host she tells of her glory:
3 
“From the mouth of the Most High I came forth,
    and covered the earth like a mist.
4 
In the heights of heaven I dwelt,
    and my throne was in a pillar of cloud.

    5: 
The vault of heaven I compassed alone,
    and walked through the deep abyss.

    6: 
Over waves of the sea, over all the land,
    over every people and nation I held sway.

    7: 
Among all these I sought a resting place.
    In whose inheritance should I abide?

    8: 
“Then the Creator of all gave me his command,
    and my Creator chose the spot for my tent.
He said, ‘In Jacob make your dwelling,
    in Israel your inheritance.’

    9: Before all ages, from the beginning, he created me,
    and through all ages I shall not cease to be.

    10: 
In the holy tent I ministered before him,
    and so I was established in Zion.

    11: 
In the city he loves as he loves me, he gave me rest;
    in Jerusalem, my domain.

    12: 
I struck root among the glorious people,
    in the portion of the Lord, his heritage.

    13: 
“Like a cedar in Lebanon I grew tall,
    like a cypress on Mount Hermon;

    14: 
I grew tall like a palm tree in Engedi,
    like rosebushes in Jericho;
Like a fair olive tree in the field,
    like a plane tree beside water I grew tall.

    15: 
Like cinnamon and fragrant cane,
    like precious myrrh I gave forth perfume;
Like galbanum and onycha and mastic,
    like the odor of incense in the holy tent.

    16: 
“I spread out my branches like a terebinth,
    my branches so glorious and so graceful.

    17: 
I bud forth delights like a vine;
    my blossoms are glorious and rich fruit.
19 
Come to me, all who desire me,
    and be filled with my fruits.[d]
20 
You will remember me as sweeter than honey,
    better to have than the honeycomb.
21 
Those who eat of me will hunger still,[e]
    those who drink of me will thirst for more.
22 
Whoever obeys me will not be put to shame,
    and those who serve me will never go astray.”
23 
All this is the book of the covenant of the Most High God,
    the Law which Moses commanded us[f]
    as a heritage for the community of Jacob.[g]
25 
It overflows, like the Pishon, with wisdom,
    and like the Tigris at the time of first fruits.
26 
It runs over, like the Euphrates, with understanding,
    and like the Jordan at harvest time.
27 
It floods like the Nile with instruction,
    like the Gihon[h] at vintage time.
28 
The first human being never finished comprehending wisdom,
    nor will the last succeed in fathoming her.
29 
For deeper than the sea are her thoughts,
    and her counsels, than the great abyss.
30 
Now I, like a stream from a river,[i]
    and like water channeling into a garden—
31 
I said, “I will water my plants,
    I will drench my flower beds.”
Then suddenly this stream of mine became a river,
    and this river of mine became a sea.
32 
Again I will make my teachings shine forth like the dawn;
    I will spread their brightness afar off.
33 
Again I will pour out instruction like prophecy
    and bestow it on generations yet to come.
