Day 227:

Reading Isaiah, chapters ['61', '62', '63', '64']:

  Chapter 61.

    1: The Anointed Bearer of Glad Tidings
1 
The spirit of the Lord God is upon me,
    because the Lord has anointed me;
He has sent me to bring good news to the afflicted,
    to bind up the brokenhearted,
To proclaim liberty to the captives,
    release to the prisoners,

    2: 
To announce a year of favor from the Lord
    and a day of vindication by our God;
To comfort all who mourn;

    3: 
    to place on those who mourn in Zion
    a diadem instead of ashes,
To give them oil of gladness instead of mourning,
    a glorious mantle instead of a faint spirit.
Restoration and Blessing
They will be called oaks of justice,
    the planting of the Lord to show his glory.

    4: 
They shall rebuild the ancient ruins,
    the former wastes they shall raise up
And restore the desolate cities,
    devastations of generation upon generation.

Restoration and Blessing
They will be called oaks of justice,
    the planting of the Lord to show his glory.
4 
They shall rebuild the ancient ruins,
    the former wastes they shall raise up
And restore the desolate cities,
    devastations of generation upon generation.
5 
Strangers shall stand ready to pasture your flocks,
    foreigners shall be your farmers and vinedressers.
6 
[b]You yourselves shall be called “Priests of the Lord,”
    “Ministers of our God” you shall be called.
You shall eat the wealth of the nations
    and in their riches you will boast.

    7: 
Because their shame was twofold
    and disgrace was proclaimed their portion,
They will possess twofold in their own land;
    everlasting joy shall be theirs.
God’s Word of Promise

    8: 
For I, the Lord, love justice,
    I hate robbery and wrongdoing;
I will faithfully give them their recompense,
    an everlasting covenant I will make with them.

    9: Their offspring shall be renowned among the nations,
    and their descendants in the midst of the peoples;
All who see them shall acknowledge them:
    “They are offspring the Lord has blessed.”
Thanksgiving for God’s Deliverance

    10: 
I will rejoice heartily in the Lord,
    my being exults in my God;
For he has clothed me with garments of salvation,
    and wrapped me in a robe of justice,
Like a bridegroom adorned with a diadem,
    as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.

    11: 
As the earth brings forth its shoots,
    and a garden makes its seeds spring up,
So will the Lord God make justice spring up,
    and praise before all the nations.


  Chapter 62.

    1: 
    2: A New Name for Zion
1 
For Zion’s sake I will not be silent,
    for Jerusalem’s sake I will not keep still,
Until her vindication shines forth like the dawn
    and her salvation like a burning torch.
2 
Nations shall behold your vindication,
    and all kings your glory;
You shall be called by a new name
    bestowed by the mouth of the Lord.

    3: 
You shall be a glorious crown in the hand of the Lord,
    a royal diadem in the hand of your God.

    4: 
No more shall you be called “Forsaken,”
    nor your land called “Desolate,”
But you shall be called “My Delight is in her,”
    and your land “Espoused.”
For the Lord delights in you,
    and your land shall be espoused.

    5: 
    6: 
A New Name for Zion
1 
For Zion’s sake I will not be silent,
    for Jerusalem’s sake I will not keep still,
Until her vindication shines forth like the dawn
    and her salvation like a burning torch.
2 
Nations shall behold your vindication,
    and all kings your glory;
You shall be called by a new name
    bestowed by the mouth of the Lord.
3 
You shall be a glorious crown in the hand of the Lord,
    a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
4 
No more shall you be called “Forsaken,”
    nor your land called “Desolate,”
But you shall be called “My Delight is in her,”
    and your land “Espoused.”
For the Lord delights in you,
    and your land shall be espoused.
5 
For as a young man marries a virgin,
    your Builder shall marry you;
And as a bridegroom rejoices in his bride
    so shall your God rejoice in you.
6 
Upon your walls, Jerusalem,
    I have stationed sentinels;
By day and by night,
    they shall never be silent.
You who are to remind the Lord,
    take no rest,

    7: 
And give him no rest,
    until he re-establishes Jerusalem
And makes it the praise of the earth.
The Blessings of Salvation for God’s People

    8: 
The Lord has sworn by his right hand
    and by his mighty arm:
No more will I give your grain
    as food to your enemies;
Nor shall foreigners drink the wine,
    for which you toiled.

    9: But those who harvest shall eat,
    and praise the Lord;
Those who gather shall drink
    in my holy courts.

    10: 
Pass through, pass through the gates,
    prepare a way for the people;
Build up, build up the highway, clear it of stones,
    raise up a standard over the nations.

    11: 
The Lord has proclaimed
    to the ends of the earth:
Say to daughter Zion,
    “See, your savior comes!
See, his reward is with him,
    his recompense before him.”

    12: 
They shall be called “The Holy People,”
    “The Redeemed of the Lord.”
And you shall be called “Cared For,”
    “A City Not Forsaken.”


  Chapter 63.

    1: 
Who is this that comes from Edom,
    in crimsoned garments, from Bozrah?
Who is this, glorious in his apparel,
    striding in the greatness of his strength?
“It is I, I who announce vindication,
    mighty to save.”

    2: 
    3: The Divine Warrior
1 
Who is this that comes from Edom,
    in crimsoned garments, from Bozrah?
Who is this, glorious in his apparel,
    striding in the greatness of his strength?
“It is I, I who announce vindication,
    mighty to save.”
2 
Why is your apparel red,
    and your garments like one who treads the wine press?
3 
“The wine press I have trodden alone,
    and from the peoples no one was with me.
I trod them in my anger,
    and trampled them down in my wrath;
Their blood spurted on my garments,
    all my apparel I stained.

    4: 
For a day of vindication was in my heart,
    my year for redeeming had come.

    5: 
    6: 
The Divine Warrior
1 
Who is this that comes from Edom,
    in crimsoned garments, from Bozrah?
Who is this, glorious in his apparel,
    striding in the greatness of his strength?
“It is I, I who announce vindication,
    mighty to save.”
2 
Why is your apparel red,
    and your garments like one who treads the wine press?
3 
“The wine press I have trodden alone,
    and from the peoples no one was with me.
I trod them in my anger,
    and trampled them down in my wrath;
Their blood spurted on my garments,
    all my apparel I stained.
4 
For a day of vindication was in my heart,
    my year for redeeming had come.
5 
I looked about, but there was no one to help,
    I was appalled that there was no one to lend support;
So my own arm brought me victory
    and my own wrath lent me support.
6 
I trampled down the peoples in my anger,
    I made them drunk in my wrath,
    and I poured out their blood upon the ground.”
Prayer for the Return of God’s Favor

    7: 
The loving deeds of the Lord I will recall,
    the glorious acts of the Lord,
Because of all the Lord has done for us,
    the immense goodness to the house of Israel,
Which he has granted according to his mercy
    and his many loving deeds.

    8: 
He said: “They are indeed my people,
    children who are not disloyal.”
So he became their savior

    9:     in their every affliction.
It was not an envoy or a messenger,
    but his presence that saved them.
Because of his love and pity
    the Lord redeemed them,
Lifting them up and carrying them
    all the days of old.

    10: 
But they rebelled
    and grieved his holy spirit;
So he turned to become their enemy,
    and warred against them.

    11: Then they remembered the days of old, of Moses, his servant:
Where is the one who brought up out of the sea
    the shepherd of his flock?
Where is the one who placed in their midst
    his holy spirit,

    12: 
Who guided Moses by the hand,
    with his glorious arm?
Where is the one who divided the waters before them—
    winning for himself an everlasting renown—

    13: 
Who guided them through the depths,
    like horses in open country?

    14: 
As cattle going down into the valley,
    they did not stumble.
    The spirit of the Lord guided them.
Thus you led your people,
    to make for yourself a glorious name.

    15: 
Look down from heaven and regard us
    from your holy and glorious palace!
Where is your zealous care and your might,
    your surge of pity?
Your mercy hold not back!

    16: 
    For you are our father.
Were Abraham not to know us,
    nor Israel to acknowledge us,
You, Lord, are our father,
    our redeemer you are named from of old.

    17: 
Why do you make us wander, Lord, from your ways,
    and harden our hearts so that we do not fear you?
Return for the sake of your servants,
    the tribes of your heritage.

    18: 
Why have the wicked invaded your holy place,
    why have our enemies trampled your sanctuary?

    19: 
Too long have we been like those you do not rule,
    on whom your name is not invoked.
Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down,
    with the mountains quaking before you,


  Chapter 64.

    1: 
As when brushwood is set ablaze,
    or fire makes the water boil!
Then your name would be made known to your enemies
    and the nations would tremble before you,

    2: 
While you worked awesome deeds we could not hope for,

    3: 
    4: 1 
As when brushwood is set ablaze,
    or fire makes the water boil!
Then your name would be made known to your enemies
    and the nations would tremble before you,
2 
While you worked awesome deeds we could not hope for,
3 
    such as had not been heard of from of old.
No ear has ever heard, no eye ever seen,
    any God but you
    working such deeds for those who wait for him.
4 
Would that you might meet us doing right,
    that we might be mindful of you in our ways!
Indeed, you are angry; we have sinned,
    we have acted wickedly.

    5: 
    6: 
1 
As when brushwood is set ablaze,
    or fire makes the water boil!
Then your name would be made known to your enemies
    and the nations would tremble before you,
2 
While you worked awesome deeds we could not hope for,
3 
    such as had not been heard of from of old.
No ear has ever heard, no eye ever seen,
    any God but you
    working such deeds for those who wait for him.
4 
Would that you might meet us doing right,
    that we might be mindful of you in our ways!
Indeed, you are angry; we have sinned,
    we have acted wickedly.
5 
We have all become like something unclean,
    all our just deeds are like polluted rags;
We have all withered like leaves,
    and our crimes carry us away like the wind.
6 
There are none who call upon your name,
    none who rouse themselves to take hold of you;
For you have hidden your face from us
    and have delivered us up to our crimes.
A Final Plea

    7: 
Yet, Lord, you are our father;
    we are the clay and you our potter:
    we are all the work of your hand.

    8: 
Do not be so very angry, Lord,
    do not remember our crimes forever;
    look upon us, who are all your people!

    9: Your holy cities have become a wilderness;
    Zion has become wilderness, Jerusalem desolation!

    10: 
Our holy and glorious house
    in which our ancestors praised you
Has been burned with fire;
    all that was dear to us is laid waste.

    11: 
Can you hold back, Lord, after all this?
    Can you remain silent, and afflict us so severely?
