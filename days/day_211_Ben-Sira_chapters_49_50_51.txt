Day 211:

Reading Ben-Sira, chapters ['49', '50', '51']:

  Chapter 49.

    1: 
The name Josiah is like blended incense,
    made lasting by a skilled perfumer.
Precious is his memory, like honey to the taste,
    like music at a banquet.

    2: 
For he grieved over our betrayals,
    and destroyed the abominable idols.

    3: 
    4: 
Josiah and the Prophets
1 
The name Josiah is like blended incense,
    made lasting by a skilled perfumer.
Precious is his memory, like honey to the taste,
    like music at a banquet.
2 
For he grieved over our betrayals,
    and destroyed the abominable idols.
3 
He kept his heart fixed on God,
    and in times of lawlessness practiced virtue.
4 
Except for David, Hezekiah, and Josiah,
    they all were wicked;
They abandoned the Law of the Most High,
    these kings of Judah, right to the very end.

    5: 
So he gave over their power to others,
    their glory to a foreign nation

    6: 
Who burned the holy city
    and left its streets desolate,

    7: 
As foretold by Jeremiah. They mistreated him
    who even in the womb had been made a prophet,
To root out, pull down, and destroy,
    and then to build and to plant.

    8: 
    9: osiah and the Prophets

    and then to build and to plant.
8 
Ezekiel beheld a vision
    and described the different creatures of the chariot;
9 
He also referred to Job,
    who always persevered in the right path.

    10: 
Then, too, the Twelve Prophets—
    may their bones flourish with new life where they lie!—
They gave new strength to Jacob
    and saved him with steadfast hope.
The Heroes After the Exile

    11: 
How to extol Zerubbabel?
    He was like a signet ring on the right hand,

    12: 
And Jeshua, Jozadak’s son?
    In their time they rebuilt the altar
And erected the holy temple,
    destined for everlasting glory.

    13: 
Exalted be the memory of Nehemiah!
    He rebuilt our ruined walls,
Restored our shattered defenses,
    and set up gates and bars.
The Earliest Patriarchs

    14: 
Few on earth have been created like Enoch;
    he also was taken up bodily.

    15: 
Was ever a man born like Joseph?
    Even his dead body was provided for.

    16: 
Glorious, too, were Shem and Seth and Enosh;
    but beyond that of any living being was the splendor of Adam.


  Chapter 50.

    1: 
Greatest of his family, the glory of his people,
    was Simeon the priest, son of Jochanan,
In whose time the house of God was renovated,
    in whose days the temple was reinforced.

    2: 
In his time also the retaining wall was built
    with powerful turrets for the temple precincts.

    3: 
In his time the reservoir was dug,
    a pool as vast as the sea.

    4: 
    5: 
Simeon, Son of Jochanan
1 
Greatest of his family, the glory of his people,
    was Simeon the priest, son of Jochanan,
In whose time the house of God was renovated,
    in whose days the temple was reinforced.
2 
In his time also the retaining wall was built
    with powerful turrets for the temple precincts.
3 
In his time the reservoir was dug,
    a pool as vast as the sea.
4 
He protected the people against brigands
    and strengthened the city against the enemy.
5 
How splendid he was as he looked out from the tent,
    as he came from behind the veil!

    6: 
Like a star shining among the clouds,
    like the full moon at the festal season;

    7: 
Like sun shining upon the temple of the King,
    like a rainbow appearing in the cloudy sky;

    8: 
Like blossoms on the branches in springtime,
    like a lily by running waters;
Like a green shoot on Lebanon in summer,

    9:     like the fire of incense at sacrifice;
Like a vessel of hammered gold,
    studded with all kinds of precious stones;

    10: 
Like a luxuriant olive tree heavy with fruit,
    a plant with branches abounding in oil;

    11: 
Wearing his glorious robes,
    and vested in sublime magnificence,
As he ascended the glorious altar
    and lent majesty to the court of the sanctuary.

    12: 
When he received the portions from the priests
    while he stood before the sacrificial wood,
His sons stood round him like a garland,
    like young cedars on Lebanon;
And like poplars by the brook they surrounded him,

    13: 
    all the sons of Aaron in their glory,
With the offerings to the Lord in their hands,
    in the presence of the whole assembly of Israel.

    14: 
Once he had completed the service at the altar
    and arranged the sacrificial hearth for the Most High,

    15: 
And had stretched forth his hand for the cup,
    to offer blood of the grape,
And poured it out at the foot of the altar,
    a sweet-smelling odor to God the Most High,

    16: 
Then the sons of Aaron would sound a blast,
    the priests, on their trumpets of beaten metal;
A blast to resound mightily
    as a reminder before the Most High.

    17: 
All the people with one accord
    would fall with face to the ground
In adoration before the Most High,
    before the Holy One of Israel.

    18: 
Then hymns would re-echo,
    and over the throng sweet strains of praise resound.

    19: 
All the people of the land would shout for joy,
    praying to the Merciful One,
As the high priest completed the service at the altar
    by presenting to God the fitting sacrifice.

    20: 
Then coming down he would raise his hands
    over all the congregation of Israel;
The blessing of the Lord would be upon his lips,
    the name of the Lord would be his glory.

    21: 
The people would again fall down
    to receive the blessing of the Most High.

    22: 
And now, bless the God of all,
    who has done wonders on earth;
Who fosters growth from the womb,
    fashioning it according to his will!

    23: 
May he grant you a wise heart
    and abide with you in peace;

    24: 
May his goodness toward Simeon last forever;
    may he fulfill for him the covenant with Phinehas
So that it may not be abrogated for him
    or his descendants while the heavens last.
Epilogue

    25: 
My whole being loathes two nations,
    the third is not even a people:

    26: 
The inhabitants of Seir and Philistia,
    and the foolish people who dwell in Shechem.

    27: 
Wise instruction, appropriate proverbs,
    I have written in this book—
I, Yeshua Ben Eleazar Ben Sira—
    as they poured forth from my heart’s understanding.

    28: 
Happy those who meditate upon these things;
    wise those who take them to heart!

    29: 
If they put them into practice, they can cope with anything,
    for the fear of the Lord is their lamp.


  Chapter 51.

    1: A Prayer of Thanksgiving
1 
I give you thanks, Lord and King,
    I praise you, God my savior!
I declare your name, refuge of my life,

    2: 
    because you have ransomed my life from death;
You held back my body from the pit,
    and delivered my foot from the power of Sheol.
You have preserved me from the scourge of the slanderous tongue,
    and from the lips of those who went over to falsehood.
You were with me against those who rise up against me;

    3: 
    You have rescued me according to your abundant mercy
From the snare of those who look for my downfall,
    and from the power of those who seek my life.
From many dangers you have saved me,

    4:

A Prayer of Thanksgiving
1 
I give you thanks, Lord and King,
    I praise you, God my savior!
I declare your name, refuge of my life,
2 
    because you have ransomed my life from death;
You held back my body from the pit,
    and delivered my foot from the power of Sheol.
You have preserved me from the scourge of the slanderous tongue,
    and from the lips of those who went over to falsehood.
You were with me against those who rise up against me;
3 
    You have rescued me according to your abundant mercy
From the snare of those who look for my downfall,
    and from the power of those who seek my life.
From many dangers you have saved me,
4 
    from flames that beset me on every side,
From the midst of fire till there was not a whiff of it,[b]
5 
    from the deep belly of Sheol,
From deceiving lips and painters of lies,

    6: 
    from the arrows of a treacherous tongue.
I was at the point of death,
    my life was nearing the depths of Sheol;

    7: 
I turned every way, but there was no one to help;
    I looked for support but there was none.

    8: 
Then I remembered the mercies of the Lord,
    his acts of kindness through ages past;
For he saves those who take refuge in him,
    and rescues them from every evil.

    9: So I raised my voice from the grave;
    from the gates of Sheol I cried for help.

    10: 
I called out: Lord, you are my Father,
    my champion, my savior!
Do not abandon me in time of trouble,
    in the midst of storms and dangers.

    11: 
I will always praise your name
    and remember you in prayer!
Then the Lord heard my voice,
    and listened to my appeal.

    12: 
He saved me from every evil
    and preserved me in time of trouble.
For this reason I thank and praise him;
    I bless the name of the Lord.
Ben Sira’s Pursuit of Wisdom

    13: 
When I was young and innocent,
    I sought wisdom.

    14: 
She came to me in her beauty,
    and until the end I will cultivate her.

    15: 
As the blossoms yielded to ripening grapes,
    the heart’s joy,
My feet kept to the level path
    because from earliest youth I was familiar with her.

    16: 
In the short time I paid heed,
    I met with great instruction.

    17: 
Since in this way I have profited,
    I will give my Teacher grateful praise.

    18: 
I resolved to tread her paths;
    I have been jealous for the good and will not turn back.

    19: 
I burned with desire for her,
    never relenting.
I became preoccupied with her,
    never weary of extolling her.
I spread out my hands to the heavens
    and I came to know her secrets.

    20: 
For her I purified my hands;
    in cleanness I attained to her.
At first acquaintance with her, I gained understanding
    such that I will never forsake her.

    21: 
My whole being was stirred to seek her;
    therefore I have made her my prize possession.

    22: 
The Lord has rewarded me with lips,
    with a tongue for praising him.

    23: 
Come aside to me, you untutored,
    and take up lodging in the house of instruction;

    24: 
How long will you deprive yourself of wisdom’s food,
    how long endure such bitter thirst?

    25: 
I open my mouth and speak of her:
    gain wisdom for yourselves at no cost.

    26: 
Take her yoke upon your neck;
    that your mind may receive her teaching.
For she is close to those who seek her,
    and the one who is in earnest finds her.

    27: 
See for yourselves! I have labored only a little,
    but have found much.

    28: 
Acquire but a little instruction,
    and you will win silver and gold through her.

    29: 
May your soul rejoice in God’s mercy;
    do not be ashamed to give him praise.

    30: 
Work at your tasks in due season,
    and in his own time God will give you your reward.
